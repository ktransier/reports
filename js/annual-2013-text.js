In recent years, Kony has <a href='http://www.lracrisistracker.com/command/evolution' target='_blank'>tended to promote younger commanders</a>, many of them abducted as young boys from northern Uganda who then served as his bodyguards and remain fiercely loyal to him. Kony has also reportedly empowered several of his sons, including Salim, an ambitious young officer raised in the bush. Meanwhile, Kony has demoted many older commanders who had military experience before joining the LRA, though his loyal second-in-command, Okot Odhiambo, retains a position of great influence.</p> <p>Kony's attempts to maintain his hold on power have come at significant risk and cost. He has authorized greater use of High-Frequency (HF) radios to maintain communications with far-flung LRA commanders, despite the danger that Ugandan military forces will use signal intercepts to track down LRA groups. Kony also reportedly <a href='http://www.theresolve.org/2013/07/new-report-how-to-dismantle-the-lra-from-the-bottom-up/' target='_blank'>ordered the execution of at least four LRA officers</a> for disobedience in late 2012 and early 2013. The most notable execution was of Otto Agweng, once one of Kony's most trusted and feared enforcers, after he raped a female captive against Kony's orders.</p> <p>Kony's disciplinary actions, like his decisions on the command hierarchy, can be unpredictable. In 2012, Kony's half-brother David Olanya also incurred Kony's wrath for sleeping with a female captive without permission. However, Kony only demoted him, perhaps in deference to his family ties. Dominic Ongwen has also escaped the full force of Kony's justice, likely due to his family ties to Kony and bravery in battle.</p><p>Mapping the LRA's command structure is extremely difficult, given lack of access to the group and Kony's constant reshuffling of responsibilities.

Many women and girls are forced into sexual relationships with male officers and fighters.

Sixty-two women and children held in long-term captivity escaped the LRA in 2013, a majority of which (32) were children originally abducted from CAR, Congo, or South Sudan. Ten Ugandan women and children long-term captives escaped the LRA in 2013, a slight reduction from the 13 who escaped in 2012.

The most recent chapter of this conflict has centered on Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, a native of western Uganda who violently seized power in 1986 after decades of misrule by dictators from the North. Since then more than twenty groups, including the LRA, have taken up arms against the government, many in response to its marginalization of Northern communities.</p><p>However, the LRA failed to capture widespread support among northern Ugandans, many of whom did not see the LRA as representing their legitimate grievances. In the early 1990s, faced with dwindling support, the LRA began to rely more heavily on abducting civilians, shifting to bases in South Sudan, and receiving support from the Khartoum government.</p><p>By 2005 the Ugandan military had significantly improved security in northern Uganda, while a  gradual end to the civil war in South Sudan also threatened the LRA's supply lines and most secure bases. In 2005 the International Criminal Court (ICC) also issued arrest warrants for five LRA commanders, including Kony, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p>The LRA adapted slowly, leaving South Sudan and establishing a sanctuary in Congo's remote Garamba National Park. In 2006, the LRA began peace negotiations with the Ugandan government mediated by South Sudanese officials. A formal ceasefire was signed in August 2006, enabling hundreds of LRA combatants remaining in South Sudan to shift towards the group's newly established bases in Congo.</p>"
