  <h3 class="page-title">Attacks by LRA vs Other Armed Groups </h3>
  <h4 class="section-title"></h4>
  <p>The LRA's reduction in major abductions and killings in favor of small-scale lootings has made it increasingly difficult for protection actors to distinguish LRA raids from attacks committed by bandits, rogue Congolese soldiers, poachers, and other armed groups. The challenge of distuingishing attacks is particularly difficult in [ ].</p>
  <p>However, Crisis Tracker analysis indicates that the LRA commits the most attacks on civilians in the areas of Congoâ€™s Haut Uele and Bas Uele districts in which it operates. In the first six months of 2013, the LRA committed XX attacks against civilians, compared with XX by other armed groups. The LRA was also responsible for XX% of civilian abductions by armed groups in these areas. </p>
