    Patterns of LRA Activity across CAR
  </h3>
  <p>The insecurity caused by the proliferation of armed groups in eastern CAR has allowed LRA groups to exploit vast stretches of ungoverned territory. The LRA committed XX attacks in CAR in the first months of 2013, killing XX people and abducting XX others, though attack patterns varied significantly in different prefectures. In Haut Mbomou prefecture and the eastern edge of Mbomou prefecture, where Ugandan troops are deployed in several locations and have prevented the advance of Seleka factions, the LRA committed 11 attacks, killing 7 people and abducting 33 others.</p>

  <p>In Haut Kotto province, where US and Ugandan troops cannot operate and Seleka factions provide little security, the LRA committed several highly violent attacks in the first half of 2013, resulting in 26 killings and 83 abductions. LRA activity followed a similar pattern in 2012, in which they committed several brazen attacks in Haut Kotto and western Mbomou province, abducting over XX people and looting large amounts of food and supplies.</p>
