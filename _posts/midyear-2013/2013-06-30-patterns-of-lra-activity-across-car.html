  </h3>
  <div id="updf-controlled-areas-of-car" class="visual"></div>

  <p>The insecurity caused by the proliferation of armed groups in eastern CAR has allowed LRA groups to exploit vast stretches of ungoverned territory. The LRA committed 25 attacks in CAR in the first six months of 2013, killing 35 people and abducting 112 others, though attack patterns varied significantly in different prefectures. 
    
In Haut Mbomou prefecture and the eastern edge of Mbomou prefecture, where Ugandan troops are deployed in several locations and have prevented the advance of Seleka factions, the LRA committed 7 attacks, killing 11 people and abducting 33 others.</p>

  <p>In Haut Kotto prefecture, where US and Ugandan troops have little access, Seleka factions are deployed in several towns. However, they provide little security to the civilian population, and the LRA committed several highly violent attacks there in the first half of 2013 in which they killed 26 people and abucuted 83 others. The LRA also committed several attacks in areas of western Mbomou prefecture outside of Ugandan military control. LRA activity followed a similar pattern in 2012, during which they committed several brazen attacks in Haut Kotto and western Mbomou, abducting over XX people and looting large amounts of food and supplies.</p>
