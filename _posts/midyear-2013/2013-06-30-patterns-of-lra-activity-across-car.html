  </h3>
  <div id="updf-controlled-areas-of-car" class="visual"></div>

  <p>The insecurity caused by the proliferation of armed groups in eastern CAR has allowed LRA groups to exploit vast stretches of ungoverned territory. The LRA committed 25 attacks in CAR in the first six months of 2013, killing 35 people and abducting 112 others, though attack patterns varied significantly in different prefectures. 
    
In Haut Mbomou prefecture and the eastern edge of Mbomou prefecture, where Ugandan troops are deployed in several locations and have prevented the advance of Seleka factions, the LRA committed 11 attacks, killing XX people and abducting XX others. Aside from one attack in which LRA forces abducted 13 hunters, these attacks were primarily small scale looting raids on isolated farmers or travelers.</p>

  <p>In Haut Kotto prefecture and western Mbomou prefecture, where US and Ugandan troops have little access, Seleka factions are deployed in several towns but provide little security to the civilian population.  In Haut Kotto, the LRA committed several highly violent attacks in the first half of 2013 in which they killed 26 people and abucuted 83 others. The LRA also committed several attacks in western Mbomou prefecture. LRA activity followed a similar pattern in 2012, during which they committed several brazen attacks in Haut Kotto and western Mbomou outside of Ugandan military control, abducting over XX people and looting large amounts of food and supplies from large villages.</p>
