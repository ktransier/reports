  <div class="caption">LRA Members Communicating with Local Populations in Congo (January 2012-June 2013) </div>

  <p>Since January 2012, LRA groups operating in Congo have attempted to communicate with local civilians at least XX times, often giving messages to people they encounter during attacks or abductees they release. XX of these messages aimed to reassure civilians that LRA forces sought only food and would not harm civilians unless attacked. In addition, LRA combatants have expressed a desire to defect from the rebel group in XX other instances, including a series of messages from alleged LRA combatants near Faradje in April and May 2013.</p>

  <p>These attempts at communication likely reflect a high degree disillusionment within LRA groups in Congo. Recent evidence suggests LRA groups in Congo are increasingly isolated from LRA senior commanders operating in CAR and Kafia Kingi enclave, and operate in significantly weaker and smaller groups.However, no Ugandan combatants defected from the LRA in Congo in the first six months of 2013.</p>
