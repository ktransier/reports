  <p>LRA forces killed two civilians in Q3 2013 - following 29 killings in Q2 and 28 killings in Q1 - the lowest number of civilian deaths per quarter in the LRA Crisis Tracker dataset. No civilian deaths were reported in DRC. Abductions and returnees both fell by roughly 50% quarter over quarter, from 136 to 67 abductions and 110 to 54 returnees from Q2 to Q3 2013.<p/>
