    Mass LRA Defection Opportunity in Nzako, CAR?
  </h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>

  <p>In August 2013, LRA forces near Banale, CAR made contact with local residents, delivering letters addressed to the local authorities in nearby Nzako and to Michael Djotodia, head of the Transitional Authorities in CAR. The letters, reportedly sent at the request of LRA leader Joseph Kony, indicated that a large group of LRA members were interested in defecting and possibly settling in Central African territory. They were delivered by a group of LRA representatives from a group operating in the area under the command of Major Otto "Sam" Ladeere, known as a trusted lieutenant of Kony's who has previously served as both his bodyguard and the LRA's Director of Intelligence. <p/>

The contact was the most significant outreach by an active LRA commander expressing a willingness to negotiate or defect since the collapse of the Juba Peace Talks in November 2008.<p/>
