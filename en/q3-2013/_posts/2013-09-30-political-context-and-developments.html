    Surge in AU RTF Counter-LRA Operations 
  </h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>

  <p>The African Union Regional Task Force, established in XX to protect civilians from the LRA and capture senior LRA leaders, launched a series of operations in Q3 2013 following a prolonged period of disengagement. Contingents from the Congolese military (FARDC), Central African military (FACA), South Sudanese military (SPLA), and Ugandan military (UPDF) were officially handed over to the AU RTF between XX and XX. However, FARDC and SPLA contingents were poorly equipped and did not conduct significant operations in the first months of their deployment. The FACA contingent was essentially dissolved following the March 2013 coup in CAR, and the new Transitional Authorities and military forces there are not officially recognized by the AU. The UPDF contingent was conducting active counter-LRA operations in CAR, but officially officially suspended them following the March 2013 coup.
