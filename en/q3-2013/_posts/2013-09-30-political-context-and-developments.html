    Surge in AU RTF Counter-LRA Operations 
  </h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>

  <p>The African Union Regional Task Force, established in XX to protect civilians from the LRA and capture senior LRA leaders, launched a series of operations in Q3 2013 following a prolonged period of disengagement. Contingents from the Congolese military (FARDC), Central African military (FACA), South Sudanese military (SPLA), and Ugandan military (UPDF) were officially handed over to the AU RTF between XX and XX. However, FARDC and SPLA contingents were poorly equipped and did not conduct significant operations in the first months of their deployment. The FACA contingent was essentially dissolved following the March 2013 coup in CAR, and the new Transitional Authorities and military forces there are not officially recognized by the AU. The UPDF contingent was conducting active counter-LRA operations in CAR, but officially officially suspended them following the March 2013 coup.
  
However, the AU RTF launched operations on several fronts in Q3 2013. In September, the FARDC destroyed an LRA camp in northern Bas Uele district of Congo, while the SPLA destroyed an LRA camp in Congo's 'Garamba National Park and investigated dozens of other sites of suspected LRA activity in the park. The operations were the first substantive offensive operations launched against the LRA in Congo since September 2011, when Congolese authorities revoked the UPDF's permission to operate in the country. Both LRA camps destroyed by the RTF forces in Congo featured small huts for sleeping and cultivated fields with vegetables and groundnuts, indicating the LRA forces there had used them as permanent campsites. In CAR, the UPDF announced the official resumption of counter-LRA operations in October, though reports indicated operations had already resumed in the previous weeks and months. 

External support was critical to the AU RTF forces recent surge in operations. US military advisers provided critical training, intelligence, and logistical support to the FARDC and SPLA units that conducted the operations in Congo, including embedding with them on multiple operations. US advisers also continue to collaborate with UPDF troops tracking the LRA in CAR, and the US provides substantial intelligence and mobility support to UPDF forces there. Meanwhile, diplomatic engagement by AU LRA envoy Amb. Francisco Madeira and Abou Moussa, the lead UN official on LRA issues, with the Congolese government and Transitional Authorities in CAR proved critical to attaining their support for RTF operations.
