    Attacks by LRA vs Unknown Armed Groups
  </h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>
  
  <p>A history of recent LRA activity in Congo demonstrates a shift away from major abductions and killings and towards small-scale lootings. This shift has made it increasingly difficult for protection actors to determine the perpetrators of the attack -- LRA, bandits, poachers, rogue Congolese soldiers, or other unidentified armed groups.</p> 

<p>In Q3 2013, the ratio of LRA attacks in LRA-affected areas of Congo to those in which armed groups were unidentified (indicating the perpetrator could include the LRA, bandits, poachers, rogue Congolese soldiers, or other armed groups) was 31 to 10 (3:1), compared to 21 to 14 (3:2) in Q2 and 44 to 24 (11:6) in Q1.</p>
