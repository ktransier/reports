<h3 class="page-title" id="section_4_title" name="resupplying_kony">IV. 11 Ugandan combatants return from the LRA</h3>
<p><span id="summary" class="label label-primary label-tldr">SUMMARY</span>
<span><i>Civilians reported a series of large-scale LRA attacks near the town of Sam Ouandja in the CAR's Haut Kotto prefecture, though lack of access to the area has limited efforts to verify the information. Separate reports indicated senior LRA commanders are once again operating in the neighboring Kafia Kingi enclave.</i></span></p>

<p>LRA leader Joseph Kony has <a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/04/report-sudans-renewed-support-to-the-lra/" target="_blank">operated periodically in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave</a>, which borders CAR's Haut Kotto and Vakaga prefectures, since 2010. Kony has utilized Kafia Kingi in multiple ways: as a safe haven from pursuing Ugandan troops, as a marketplace to barter ivory poached in Congo, and as an outpost to rekindle the LRA's historic relationship with the Sudanese military. Not wanting to alienate Sudanese troops, LRA forces have rarely if ever attacked civilians in the enclave. Instead, they have periodically sent raiding parties into the CAR to loot civilians there, beginning with a series of eight attacks in Haut Kotto and Vakaga prefectures in late 2010.</p>

<p>Kony was last confirmed to be in Kafia Kingi in March 2013, just before he fled to the CAR in advance of a Ugandan military attack on his camps in the enclave. After a series of large-scale raids on Central African towns in Haut Kotto in the aftermath of the Ugandan operations, LRA forces committed relatively few attacks there between July and November 2013.</p>

<p>In December 2013, reports of LRA activity in Haut Kotto began to increase. From December 2013&ndash;March 2014, civilians near Sam Ouandja, a diamond-mining town less than 50km from the Kafia Kingi border, reported seven LRA attacks in which the rebel group allegedly abducted 91 people. Sam Ouandja is not well connected to early warning networks in the CAR, and no international aid groups or UN agencies have bases there, making it very difficult to verify reports of attacks and who perpetrated them.</p>

<p>Despite this, there are several reasons to believe civilians are correct in identifying the LRA as the perpetrator of the seven reported attacks near Sam Ouandja. The perpetrators abducted people in all seven attacks, and abducted ten or more people in four of the attacks. Many of the abductees were forced to porter looted supplies into the bush before being released. These characteristics are very similar to LRA attacks patterns in recent years, particularly those in Vakaga prefecture in 2010, Mbomou prefecture in 2012, and Haut Kotto prefecture in mid-2013.</p>

<p>Other sources, including LRA defectors, have indicated LRA leaders such as Joseph Kony are again operating in Kafia Kingi, which borders Haut Kotto. If these reports are true, the Sam Ouandja area would be an ideal location for LRA forces operating in the enclave to loot supplies for their survival.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="section_5_title">V. CAR: Ugandan fighters defect from the LRA</h3>
<p><span id="summary" class="label label-primary label-tldr">SUMMARY</span>
<span><i>Eighteen LRA members who had been with the group for at least six months <a href="http://invisiblechildren.com/blog/2014/02/17/radar-male-defector-corroborates-odhiambo-rumor-four-escape-lra-car-feb-9th/" target="_blank">escaped in Quarter 1 2014</a>, including five Ugandan male combatants, five women, and eight children.</i></span></p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3">

<p>LRA Crisis Tracker data estimated there was <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/" target="_blank">160&ndash;168 Ugandan male combatants</a> remaining within the LRA by the end of 2013, following the defection, capture, or killing of between 32&ndash;40 combatants that year. Since then, the five LRA combatant defections in Quarter 1 2014 represent an additional 3% reduction in the LRA's fighting capacity.</p>

<p>All five Ugandan combatants who escaped the LRA in Quarter 1 2014 did so in eastern CAR. Since 2012, 87% of all Ugandan combatant defectors have escaped there, most commonly in the Vovodo-Chinko river basin and near towns with Ugandan military bases such as Mboki, Djemah, and Obo. The concentration of LRA combatant defections in this area is likely due to a number of factors, including the presence of Ugandan military bases, the concentration of LRA groups in the CAR, and the relative saturation of "Come Home" defection messaging there. Six of the ten adults who escaped the LRA in Quarter 1 2014 were influenced by Come Home defection messages delivered by fliers, helicopter speakers, or FM and shortwave radio. </p>
