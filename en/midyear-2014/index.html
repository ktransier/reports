<h3 class="page-title" id="section_1_title" >I. Congo: LRA attacks rise sharply in 2014</h3>
<p><span id="summary" class="label label-primary label-tldr">SUMMARY</span>
<span><i>LRA violence continued to surge in Congo’s northeastern Haut Uele district, particularly west of Garamba National Park. The LRA abducted 153 Congolese civilians in the first half of 2014, more than doubling the number abducted in the first half of 2013 (72) and reversing a four-year decline in LRA abductions in Congo.</i></span></p>     

<p>Halfway through 2014, the LRA’s patterns of movement also continue to evolve.  In the first three months of 2014, LRA attacks in Congo were concentrated in the Niangara-Bangadi-Ngilima triangle, west of Garamba National Park. Since April, LRA attacks have shifted further west and north, towards the vicinity of Doruma and Masombo, near the border with South Sudan. Between June 7th and July 7th, the LRA committed 11 attacks in this area, including large scale lootings of civilians traveling to and from the busy Nabiapay border market. Merchants and market-goers laden with goods and currency present easy targets for small, highly mobile bands of LRA forces that roam this sparsely inhabited area.</p>

<p>Overall, the LRA committed 44 attacks in Congo's Haut Uele and Bas Uele districts in Quarter 2 2014, up 13% from the 39 attacks in Quarter 1.  civilians abducted in 39 in Quarter 1.  LRA abductions in Congo rose 43%, from 63 in Quarter 1 to 90 in Quarter 2. The majority of these abductions lasted fewer than 30 days, as many abductees were forced to carry looted goods before being released after a few hours or days. This trend, as well as a continued decline in the number of LRA killings in Congo, is consistent with a reduction in child abductions and large massacres in recent years as the group has attempted to deflect international attention from the crisis.</p>  

<p>The overall increase in LRA activity in Haut Uele district masks the remarkable decline in LRA attacks south and east of Garamba National Park, once an LRA stronghold in Haut Uele. Several alleged LRA attacks were reported in this area in the first six months of 2014, but none met standards necessary to be recorded as an LRA attack by the Crisis Tracker.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="section_2_title" >II. Congo: Unidentified armed groups</h3>
<p><span id="summary" class="label label-primary label-tldr">The increase in LRA activity in Haut Uele district in 2014 has been accompanied by a 55% increase in the number of attacks committed by unidentified armed groups, from 27 attacks in the first half of 2013 to 42 attacks in the first half of 2014.</span>
<span><i></i></span></p>

<div id="MY2014_Congo_2" class="visual" style="height: 300px; margin-top: 0px;"></div>

<p><i>Note on Methodology: In June 2014, the LRA Crisis Tracker team did an extensive review of its dataset on non-state armed group attacks on civilians in LRA-affected areas. The perpetrator of each attacked is now categorized as either the “LRA,” an “unidentified armed group,” or an “other armed group.” “Unidentified armed group” is used for attacks for which sources do not provide enough details to accurately identify the perpetrator. The assailants in these attacks could be security forces, poachers, Mbororos, LRA, or any other armed groups. “Other armed group” is used for attacks for which there are enough details to definitively identify the perpetrator as an armed actor other than the LRA. Incidents  of abuses against civilians by state security forces are recorded separately and not included in these three categories.</i></p>

<p>As LRA attacks in Congo have become less violent in recent years, it has become more difficult to distinguish attacks by the LRA from attacks by bandits and other armed actors, resulting in a reduced inclination to identify assailants as being LRA. Consequently, the rise in attacks by unidentified armed groups in Haut Uele could indicate increased predation on civilians by the LRA, bandits, or other armed groups.</p>

<p>Regardless of the difficulty in identifying perpetrators, reporting trends clearly indicate both a rise in LRA and overall armed group violence against civilians in Haut Uele, with the number of attacks in the first half of 2014 the highest since early 2012. LRA forces are still responsible for over half of all reported non-state armed group attacks in Haut-Uele in 2014, and possibly more depending on how many incidents categorized as unidentified armed group attacks were actually committed by the LRA.This overwhelming impact demonstrates the continued threat that LRA rebels pose Congolese communities, both as direct perpetrators of attacks and as contributors to an atmosphere of lawlessness that encourages other armed groups to attack civilians with impunity.</p>

<p>Recent reports indicate that local security forces in Haut Uele have done little to mitigate the intensification of armed group violence in Haut Uele. Many Congolese civilians feel that Congolese military (FARDC) and UN peacekeeping forces (MONUSCO) frequently fail to take advantage of actionable intelligence to pursue armed groups and are able to deter attacks on only a handful of major towns. The inaction of security forces could also weaken ties with surrounding communities, as could reports this year of FARDC troops committing abuses against civilians, including rape, extortion, and torture.</p>
