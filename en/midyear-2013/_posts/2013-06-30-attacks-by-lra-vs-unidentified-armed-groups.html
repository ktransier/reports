  <p>The LRA's reduction in major abductions and killings in favor of small-scale lootings has made it increasingly difficult for protection actors to distinguish LRA raids from attacks committed by bandits, rogue Congolese soldiers, poachers, and other armed groups. Consequently, LRA activity contributes to a broader dynamic of insecurity in Haut and Bas Uele districts that will likely persist in some form even if the LRA should end its attacks there.</p>
  <p>However, Crisis Tracker analysis indicates that the LRA still commits the most attacks on civilians in the areas of Congoâ€™s Haut Uele and Bas Uele districts in which it operates. In the first six months of 2013, the LRA committed 62 attacks against civilians in Congo, while the Crisis Tracker recorded 26 attacks by unidentified armed groups, which could include the LRA, bandits, poachers, rogue Congolese soldiers, or other armed groups.</p>
