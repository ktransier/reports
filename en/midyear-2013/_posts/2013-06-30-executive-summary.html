    Executive Summary: 3 Key Trends in LRA Activity
  </h3>

  <b>1. LRA attacks continue to decline, particularly in Congo</b>

  <p>The LRA committed 90 attacks in the first half of 2013, a 54% drop from the 194 attacks it committed in the first half of 2012. In particular, Democratic Repubulic of the Congo (Congo) experienced a significant drop, from 158 in the first half of 2012 to 66 in the first half of 2013.<p/>

  <b>2. Despite decrease in attacks, LRA killings on the rise</b><br />
  <p>Despite the dramatic drop in attacks, LRA forces killed more civilians in the first half of 2013 (47) than they did in the first half of 2012 (32), a 47% increase.<p/>

  <b>3. LRA groups exploiting security vacuum in eastern CAR</b> <br />
  <p>The LRA committed its most notable attacks in the first half of 2013 in Haut Kotto prefecture, part of the vast area in eastern Central African Republic (CAR) experiencing a security vacuum since the March 2013 coup in Bangui. In June 2013 alone, LRA groups reportedly killed 30 civilians and abducted 68 more in Haut Kotto, which Ugandan and US soldiers stationed primarily in neighboring Haut Mbomou prefecture can rarely access. Overall, 56% of LRA killings and 42% of LRA abductions in the first half of 2013 occurred in Haut Kotto.<p/>

  <b>4. Nearly 5% of Ugandan combatants defect from the LRA</b> <br />
  <p>There are approximately 180-200 Ugandan combatants within the LRA, who comprise the core of the LRA's fighting force. In the first half of 2013, 8 of these Ugandan combatants defected from the rebel group in CAR, as well as one in Congo, representing a loss of nearly 5% of the LRA's Ugandan combatant capacity. Another Ugandan LRA combatant was captured park rangers in Congo's Garamba National Park following a clash with an LRA group. In addition, 44 other people who had been with the LRA for six months of longer returned from the LRA between January and June 2013, including 28 women and children released by LRA combatants in Bas Uele in March.<p/>
