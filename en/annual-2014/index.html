  <div class="card-title">1. Total LRA attacks and abductions reversed their decline</div>

    <p>From 2011-2013, LRA attacks and abductions declined compared to the previous year, reflecting the group’s reduced fighting capacity and Kony’s intentional strategy to minimize international attention. However, LRA violence rose in 2014 compared to 2013, with attacks increasing by XX% and abductions by XX%.</p>  

    <p>Despite the uptick in violence, the nature of LRA attacks remained consistent with recent years. Nearly all LRA attacks were aimed at looting basic goods needed to survive, with most abductees escaping or being released within days. The increase in such attacks may be in part a ripple effect of African Union and US military forces in late 2013 that destroyed several LRA farms and campsites, forcing established LRA groups to loot more communities to survive.</p>

    <p>The overall increase in LRA violence in 2014 masks significant variations at more local scales. In Congo’s Haut Uele district, communities south and east of Garamba National Park experienced a dramatic drop in LRA violence. In areas west of the park, LRA forces abducted more people than they had since 2011. Similar patterns emerged in eastern CAR. LRA forces abducted 134 people in the western half of Haut Kotto prefecture in 2013 and none in 2014, while in nearby areas of Mbomou prefecture abductions rose from zero to 112.</p>  

    <p>The unpredictability of LRA attacks from year-to-year is partly why the LRA is able to destabilize such a vast swath of territory despite its reduced fighting capacity. Farmers become discouraged from planting crops in rural areas even if LRA attacks drop, knowing they may increase in just a few months. Meanwhile,  humanitarian groups may reduce operations in one area only to find needs increase as LRA attacks rise, as happened in western Haut Uele in 2014.</p>

    <p>In recent years the LRA has begun attacking civilians in smaller groups and abducting and killing few people per incident, a modus operandi that more closely resembles that of bandits, rogue security forces, and poachers. As it becomes more difficult to distinguish LRA lootings from attacks by such actors, the interpretation of attack reports becomes</p>  

    <p>The LRA Crisis Tracker is the only actor to publicly report statistics on violent incidents in LRA-affected areas perpetrated by both LRA forces and other armed actors (see more on our Methodology). Crisis Tracker data for the past three years has reflected the increased difficulty of differentiating perpetrators by tagging the perpetrators of a growing proportion of incidents as those committed by unidentified armed groups (some of which may actually be LRA attacks). Crisis Tracker data demonstrates that despite this, the number of attacks attributable to the LRA increased, challenging observers who dismiss claims of increased LRA activity as faulty reporting.</p>

  <div class="card-text-container">
    <p>Since 2012, a significant number of the LRA’s senior commanders have defected (Ceasar Achellam, Opio Sam, Dominic Ongwen), been killed by the UPDF (Okot Odhiambo, Binany Okumu, Otim Ferry), or been executed on Kony’s orders (Otto Agweng). Their loss, combined with losses in the LRA’s rank-and-file,  pose a major threat to Kony’s ability motivate and control remaining fighters.</p>  

    <p>Still, Kony is a master manipulator who frequently reshuffles the LRA command hierarchy to compensate for losses at the top. In the past year alone he has promoted his sons (Ali, Salim), young loyalists who were once his bodyguards (Aligac), older commanders he had once demoted (Alphonse Lamola), and those who perform well in the field (Owila, who brought him over 50 ivory tusks from poached elephants in late 2014).</p>

  <div class="card-text-container">
    <p>Kony commanded over 2,000 fighters during the LRA’s peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, armed with sophisticated weaponry and communications equipment. By 2008, military operations, internal splits, and defections had reduced the LRA’s fighting force to 800. In 2013, 17 Ugandan fighters, who comprise the core of the group, defected or were captured. Between XX and XX more died, including ICC-indictee Okot Odhiambo, mostly killed by Ugandan troops or executed on Kony’s orders. In total, approximately 160 Ugandan fighters remained within the LRA by the end of 2013.</p> 

    <p>Of those 160 Ugandan fighters, at least 13 defected or were captured in 2014, with no reported deaths. This was a significant drop the XX-XX fighters the LRA lost in 2013. To offset the LRA’s losses, Kony has been slowly promoting dozens of non-Ugandan abductees within the group’s junior officer ranks, a move which could meet resistance Ugandan combatants.</p>

  <div class="card-text-container">
    <p>Senior LRA officers rely heavily on women and children, many abducted and other born in the bush, for their day-to-day survival. Women and children collect food and water, cook, carry possessions from camp to camp, and serve as forced wives and occasionally combatants. In mid-2014, Kony ordered the release of over XX long-term abductees in a remote village in northern Congo, the same location where the LRA released 28 women and children in March 2013.</p>   

    <p>In total, XX women and children who spent at least six months in the LRA returned home in 2014, a significant portion of those remaining in LRA ranks and double the number who returned in 2013. Their loss may allow LRA groups to move faster and evade Ugandan troops, but it will also make life harder for senior LRA officers and may contribute to their desire to defect.</p>

    <p>The LRA has been remarkably resilient to military pressure, utilizing a sophisticated network of camps and resupply routes to crisscross the porous borders and remote forests that restrict the movements of pursuing Ugandan and US troops. Broken into small groups, they survive by looting small communities, farming and foraging where possible, and using “collaborators” (often forced into service) to purchase petty goods.</p>  

    <p>In recent years Kony has given orders to complement these survival strategies with trafficking in illegal natural resources. In mid-2014, an LRA group collected approximately 50 ivory tusks poached from elephants in Congo’s Garamba National Park, while other groups have been tasked with looting gold and diamonds from artisanal mining sites in eastern CAR. Ivory and most gold and diamonds are delivered to Kony’s group, which operates along the border of northeastern CAR and the Kafia Kingi enclave. There the LRA has a network of contacts including Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) troops, community leaders, and traders who they have utilized since 2009 to trade illicit goods for food, medicine, and munitions.</p>

  <div class="card-text-container">
    <p>The role of Seleka rebels in the defection of senior LRA defector Dominic Ongwen was simply the latest chapter in a rollercoaster relationship between the two groups. They first came into contact in 2010, when LRA forces clashed repeatedly with UFDR rebels (one of the groups comprising Seleka) as they pushed north into the Kafia Kingi enclave to establish contact with Sudanese troops.</p> 

    <p>After taking power in a coup in March 2013, Seleka forces faced pressure to address community concerns about LRA violence. Lacking the military capacity to defeat the LRA, Seleka officers met with LRA groups periodically in late 2013 and into 2014, forcing local communities to give them food in an attempt to discourage attacks and encourage defections. LRA defectors report that in some cases such contact eventually morphed into an opportunistic trading relationship, with Seleka forces taking advantage of the LRA’s ability to loot gold and diamonds in remote mining sites.</p>
