    <h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>[1] Joseph Kony’s rise from humble beginnings to one of the world’s most infamous war criminals has spanned the tenures of five US presidents and taken him across a vast swath of east and central Africa. Despite being the subject of countless media reports he has remained an elusive figure, spurning the outside world and isolating himself in remote jungle hideouts. This has been especially true since 2008, when he had his last confirmed communication with anyone outside of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA).</p> 

    <p>This report maps and analyzes Kony’s movements since 2005, when the International Criminal Court (ICC) released indictments for him and four other LRA commanders, making him instantly infamous and even more cautious of contact with the outside world. The report provides the most comprehensive public record ever released of Kony’s movements since then, drawing on testimonies from defected LRA combatants and victims of violence, satellite imagery analysis, and dozens of reports from media, civil society, and military sources.[2]<span id="tracking-kony-break-2"></span> It also chronicles LRA attacks on civilians associated with Kony’s group, many of which were conducted on his direct orders.</p> 

    <p>Kony’s movements reveal a complex leader who is both extremely isolated yet well-informed about regional political dynamics, exploiting civil conflict and state rivalries to evade his pursuers. Kony spent 2005 and early 2006 in South Sudan, long an LRA stronghold where the group enjoyed support from the Sudanese government. In March 2006 Kony fled to the remote Garamba National Park in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo), where the entire LRA force stayed for nearly three years during peace talks with the Ugandan government. He fled the park in December 2008 when Ugandan troops attacked LRA bases in Garamba, the first of several times over the following years when Kony narrowly escaped capture. Folllowing the Ugandan military assault, Kony took refuge in the Central African Republic (CAR), moving locations frequently there for over three years. Since late 2012, he has operated primarily in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave and the remote areas of northeastern CAR that it borders. Far from Ugandan military bases and surrounded by a volatile mix of armed groups, the region provides an ideal hiding location that Kony will likely not soon leave.</p> 

    <h3 class="page-title">January 2005-February 2006: Sunset in South Sudan</h3>
    <p>Kony spent his childhood and early adulthood in northern Uganda, coming of age during a time of intense civil strife in the country. In the late 1980s he became involved in a series of rebel groups fighting the Ugandan government, culminating in his formation of the LRA. In 1994, Kony and the bulk of LRA forces moved into southern Sudan, where they found a benefactor in the Sudanese government, a regional rival of Uganda. For the next ten years the Sudanese military (SAF) frequently provided the LRA with safe haven, including homes in Juba, and trained them in ambush combat tactics. They also provided the group with food, medical supplies, ammunition, and weapons, including automatic rifles, anti-aircraft guns, rocket-propelled, grenade launchers, and mortars. In return, the LRA destabilized northern Uganda and fought the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) rebel group on behalf of the Sudanese military.</p> 

    <p>[3]Thawing relations between Sudan and Uganda and the signing of a peace agreement between Sudan and SPLA in 2005 led to the gradual withdrawal of SAF forces from southern Sudan. This, combined with the ICC’s announcement of indictments on LRA commanders in late 2005, heralded the end of Kony’s decade-long stay in South Sudan.</p>

    <p>[4]Kony’s exit from South Sudan was difficult. In early 2005 he was based near the Juba-Torit road in Eastern Equatoria, north of his long-time hideouts in the Imatong Mountains. In August and September he held several large meetings with senior LRA commanders in which they planned their move to Congo. Vincent Otti, Kony’s senior deputy, travelled to Congo’s Garamba National Park in September 2005 to scout locations for new LRA bases. From October 2005 to January 2006 Kony operated around the South Sudanese capital of Juba, avoiding Ugandan military attacks and waiting for Otti to establish a presence in Congo. In February 2006 Kony crossed over the Nile River north of Kajo Keji and began the weeks-long journey to Congo. 

    <h3 class="page-title">March 2006 - December 2008: Regrouping during the Juba Peace Talks</h3>
    <p>Kony entered Congo for the first time on March 8, 2006. He crossed from South Sudan with 70 fighters near the town of Aba and then travelled west to Garamba National Park, where he met Otti. Once in Congo, he ordered LRA fighters to begin constructing a series of camps in and near Garamba park.</p> 

    <p>[5]At the same time as he was settling into the remote Congolese forest, Kony made an unprecedented effort to reveal himself to the outside world. In May 2006, Kony was filmed meeting with South Sudanese Vice-President Riek Machar, who gave Kony $20,000 as an incentive to enter into peace talks with the Ugandan government. The next month Kony allowed BBC reporters to interview him for the first time on camera. Peace negotiations between the LRA and Ugandan government began the following month, mediated by the South Sudanese government with support from a host of UN and international envoys. Though Kony did not participate directly in most of the ensuing negotiations, he did meet with mediators in the remote jungle at least three times, in November and December of 2006 and March and August of 2007.</p> 

    <p>At the same time he was entertaining peace negotiations, Kony was also preparing contingency plans in case the talks failed. In January 2007, he ordered LRA officer Okot Odhiambo to cross into the CAR and identify a location where the LRA could move to avoid future attacks by military forces. After Odhiambo returned to Garamba park empty-handed, Kony ordered another LRA officer to head further south to establish contact with the PRA, another Ugandan rebel group operating in Congo. [6]After this mission failed as well, Kony came under increasing internal pressure to seriously engage the peace talks.</p> 

    <p>Still skeptical of the peace talks and fearing Otti’s growing popularity, Kony ordered his execution in October 2007. Kony then reorganized the LRA’s hierarchy, transferring almost all power beneath him from senior officers who had joined the LRA in the late 1980s to young commanders who had been abducted and indoctrinated within LRA ranks.</p>

    <p>[7]Two months after Otti’s execution, Kony again sent Odhiambo into the CAR, this time with orders to abduct hundreds of new recruits. Odhiambo returned to Garamba park with new recruits in April 2008, just days before Kony failed to show up for the signing of the final peace agreement between the LRA and the Ugandan government. Over the next eight months, Kony set up several new bases in and around Garamba park and cut himself off from peace talks mediators and even his own delegation to the talks. In December 2008, following one last attempt to engage Kony by northern Ugandan civil society leaders, Ugandan troops attacked LRA bases in Garamba park. The assault was poorly planned and failed to capture Kony or any senior LRA commanders.</p> 

    <h3 class="page-title">January 2009 - October 2009: Close calls in the CAR</h3>
    <p>Following the Ugandan military assault on Garamba, Kony fled west towards the Congolese communities of Bitima and Duru. [8]He then ordered what became known as the Christmas Massacres, a series of brutal attacks on Congolese and South Sudanese communities in late December and early January in which LRA forces killed XX people and abducted XX others. Kony operated west of Garamba park for several months, and may have even temporarily moved into neighboring Western Equatoria State in South Sudan. In May 2009, Kony and a group of 250 people, left Congo, crossing north into the CAR where two senior LRA commanders, Odhiambo and Bok Abudema, were operating. Upon crossing into the CAR, Kony promised his followers that they would be safe from Ugandan military attacks, unaware that the Ugandan army was already preparing to chase the LRA from Congo into the CAR.</p> 

    <p>Kony’s group first entered the CAR in Haut Mbomou, the country’s far southeastern prefecture. From there he moved north of Obo, the capital of Haut Mbomou, and established a camp. LRA violence near Obo in the following months was worse than it ever has been since, with LRA fighters abducting 133 people and killing 94 others in over 45 attacks. In one attack on the town of Maboussou led by Kony’s half-brother David Olanya, three people were killed between 8-14 others abducted. The abductees were later brought before Kony, who allowed them to live.</p> 

    <p>In early September 2009, Ugandan troops attacked Kony’s camp north of Obo, forcing him and his group to flee. Kony was reportedly injured during the battle and later received medical treatment from a group of Arab traders his group encountered.</p> 

    <p>Weeks later, the Ugandan military had its third near-miss on Kony in less than year. After fleeing the Obo area, Kony’s group moved towards the remote town of Djemah. LRA fighters attacked the village in the early morning hours of October 2, planning to secure the town for Kony’s arrival. However, the fighters were unaware that a Ugandan military contingent had arrived in Djemah just days before. The Ugandan troops attacked the LRA fighters and then pursued them back towards Kony’s hiding place, killing 25 LRA fighters and capturing two of Kony’s “wives” over the course of the next few days.</p> 

    <h3 class="page-title">November 2009 - December 2010: First foray to Kafia Kingi</h3></h3>
    <p>Kony’s group fled south and then east from Djemah, attacking several villages before evading Ugandan troops and settling into the area east of Obo for several months. In early March 2010, Kony’s group then moved back into northeastern Congo, spending at least several weeks there and meeting with top LRA commanders there such as Binany Okumu and Dominic Ongwen.</p>

    <p>Kony did not stay in Congo for long, and by mid-2010 he was moving north towards the Kafia Kingi enclave. Otto Agweng, a feared enforcer and one of Kony’s most trusted deputies, had made first contact with Sudanese military forces there in October 2009. Agweng had reported to Kony after returning from Kafia Kingi, receiving a promotion from the LRA leader for his hard work.</p>  

    <p>This paved the way for Kony, who arrived in Kafia Kingi in October 2010, establishing a camp near the Sudanese military garrison at Dafak. Kony never met with Sudanese military officials himself, but sent emissaries to make contact. He also ordered a series of raids on nearby communities in the CAR to gather supplies for his group. In December 2010, Kony decided to return to the CAR, leaving officer Otim Ferry in charge of a small LRA group to remain in Kafia Kingi.</p> 

    <h3 class="page-title">January 2011 - November 2012: Hiding out in Congo and the CAR</h3>
    <p>In January 2011, Kony crossed the Mbomou River from the CAR into northeastern Congo’s Bas Uele district. He then reportedly moved further east into Haut Uele district, though little is known of exact whereabouts during much of early 2011. By August 2011 Kony’s group had crossed back into the CAR and was again operating near the towns of Obo and Djemah. In October 2011, Ugandan military officials claimed they had nearly captured Kony, but that he had escaped while his bodyguards battled with Ugandan troops.</p> 

    <p>Kony remained in southeastern CAR for most of late 2011 and early 2012, which suffered from sustained LRA attacks during this period. In April 2012, Kony reportedly gathered several of his top commanders for a meeting at a large rock outcropping north of Obo. Like many other features of the landscape in the region, LRA forces gave the rock outcropping their own unique name: Mt. Foisha, named after one of Kony’s “wives.”</p> 

    <h3 class="page-title">December 2012 - September 2014: The Kafia Kingi years</h3>
    <p>Though it is difficult to know Kony’s whereabouts for much of mid-2012, but December 2012 he had made his way from southeastern CAR back to Kafia Kingi. There he established himself in a series of camps near Dafak, which lies near the Umbelesha River. There the LRA group led by Otim Ferry had established a system of survival that included trading at local markets and with Sudanese troops, hunting, and growing crops.</p> 

    <p>Binany Okumu, one of Kony’s most trusted commanders, arrived in Kafia Kingi to meet with the LRA leader in late 2012 or early 2013, after undertaking a perilous journey from LRA bases in Congo. Kony had ordered LRA groups in Congo to collect ivory poached from elephants in Garamba National Park in 2012, and Binany was reportedly tasked with delivering the ivory to Kony. Soon after Binany left Kafia Kingi, likely to return to Congo, he was killed in an ambush by Ugandan troops. Weeks later, Kony ordered the execution of Otto Agweng, his long-time enforcer. Agweng had allegedly angered Kony by raping a female captive against his orders.</p>

    <p>Following the successful ambush of Binany’s LRA group in January 2013, Ugandan and US military forces prepared to strike Kony’s camp in Kafia Kingi. They launched a strike in early March, only to find that the LRA leader had already fled his camps Kafia Kingi and had likely returned to the CAR.</p> 

    <p>Little details have surfaced publicly about Kony’s whereabouts since early 2013, but LRA defectors and military sources consistently indicate he remains either in Kafia Kingi or just across the border in the CAR. Lost Odhiambo, promoted Salim and Ali.</p>
