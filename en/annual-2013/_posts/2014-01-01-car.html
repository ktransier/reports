<h3 class="page-title">I. Shifting attack patterns in CAR</h3>
<div class="page-subtitle"></div>
<p>The LRA first major foray into CAR was in March 2008, when it abducted dozens of people in series of brazen raids near Obo, the capital of Haut Mbomou prefecture. Ugandan troops established a base in Obo in early 2009, and conducted several successful operations against the LRA in nearby Djemah that year. In response, LRA troops pushed further west and north in 2010, committing massive attacks in the prefectures of Mbomou, Haut Kotto, and Vakaga. After a drop in LRA attacks in 2011, LRA forces conducted a series of prominent raids in Mbomou, including the looting of a French uranium mining camp.</p>  

<h3 class="page-title">II. Mass LRA attacks where ex-Seleka troops rule</h3>
<div class="page-subtitle"></div>
<p>In 2013, LRA troops shifted further north into Haut Kotto, conducting large scale attacks in areas under the nominal control of ex-Seleka rebels, mostly loyal to General Demane of former <i>L'Union des forces d√©mocratiques pour le rassemblement (UFDR)</i>. Ugandan RTF troops remain primarily based in Haut Mbomou and have limted access in outlying areas, primarily due to logistical contraints.</p>
