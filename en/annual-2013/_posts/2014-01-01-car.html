<h3 class="page-title">I. Shifting attack patterns in CAR</h3>
<div id="A13_Prefectures" class="visual" style="height: 350px; margin-top: 0px;"></div> 
<p>The LRA first major foray into CAR was in March 2008, when it abducted dozens of people in series of brazen raids near Obo, the capital of Haut Mbomou prefecture. Ugandan troops established a base in Obo in early 2009, and conducted several successful operations against the LRA in nearby Djemah that year. In response, LRA troops pushed further west and north in 2010, committing massive attacks in the prefectures of Mbomou, Haut Kotto, and Vakaga. After a drop in LRA attacks in 2011, LRA forces conducted a series of prominent raids in Mbomou, including the looting of a French uranium mining camp.</p>

<h3 class="page-title">II. Mass LRA attacks where ex-Seleka troops operate</h3>
<div class="page-subtitle"></div>
<p>In 2013, LRA troops shifted further north into Haut Kotto, conducting large scale attacks in areas under the nominal control of ex-Seleka rebels, most of whom are loyal to General Demane of the former <i>L'Union des forces democratiques pour le rassemblement (UFDR)</i>. Ugandan RTF troops remain primarily based in Haut Mbomou and have limted access in outlying areas, primarily due to logistical contraints.</p>

<p>Map similar to the one in the mid-year brief, this time highlighting three data sets (just 2013 data): "Mass attacks in areas controlled by ex-Seleka forces", "Mass attacks controlled by Ugandan RTF forces" and "Other attacks"</p>

<p>PAUL: Is the graph for just AU-controlled areas, or all of CAR? The presence of Ugandan RTF troops in Haut Mbomou prefecture has deterred massive LRA raids there. However, rebel forces continue to conduct periodic small-scale looting raids that make travelling along roads or to remote fields risky and have forced thousands of civilians into long-term displacement. In early 2013, LRA rebels committed six attacks near the town of Zemio, home to a small Ugandan RTF detachment. They then abducted 36 people just across the border from Zemio in Congo on October. LRA forces also committed a series of attacks on roads leading to Djemah, the site of a larger Ugandan RTF base, most notably an abduction of 13 hunters near Derbissaka in April 2013.</p>
