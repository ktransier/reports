<!-- LRA LOOTINGS -->
<h3 class="page-title">I. Steady decline of LRA violence in Congo</h3>
  <div id="A13_Decline" class="visual" style="height: 270px; margin-top: 0px;"></div> 
<p>From 2008-2010, the LRA was one of the deadliest groups in Congo, killing over 2,300 civilians. LRA violence has steadily declined since then, with only 39 killings in the past two years. One trend has been consisent over the past six years: The concentration of LRA attacks west and south of Congo's Garamba National Park, where the group has maintained a series of semi-permanent camps in the dense forest.</p>

<h3 class="page-title">II. Hunting, fishing, and farming in the LRA's shadow</h3>

<p><i>*This graph provides a snapshot of how LRA attacks threaten Congolese civilians engaging in livelihood activities, though it likely underestimates each category due to lack of detailed information on many attacks.</i></p>
<p>A vast majority of civilians in LRA-affected areas of Congo rely on access to fields, forests, and rivers to sustain or supplement their livelihoods. Many civilians also travel to local markets to sell their bounty or participate in petty trading. LRA attacks make engaging in these livelihoods very dangerous, but many people have little choice but to take the risk.</p> 
<p>Troops from Congolese army and the United Nations mission to Congo (MONUSCO) are deployed throughout the region, but can do little but deter LRA raids on major towns. Many civilians utilize self protection techniques, such as traveling in groups along roads and to fields, to reduce their vulnerability to LRA attacks.</p>


<!-- LRA VS UAG -->

<h3 class="page-title">III. LRA vs UAG attacks</h3>
<div class="page-subtitle"></div>
<p>High rates of LRA violence in northeastern Congo have destabilized an area already plagued by poor goverance and lawlessness, contributing to an environment that encourages a variety of armed actors to prey on civilians. In particular, Garamba National Park's dense forests and lucrative wild game attract LRA fighters, rogue Congolese soldiers, local poachers, and heavily armed Sudanese and South Sudanese poachers. Using the forest for refuge, these armed groups attack travelers and villages on roads running west and south of the park. 

These armed actors often use tactics similar to the LRA's, making it difficult for protection actors to identify perpetrators. In LRA-affected areas of Congo in 2013, the ratio of LRA attacks to those in which the armed group was unidentified (indicating the perpetrator could be the LRA, bandits, poachers, rogue Congolese soldiers, or other armed groups) was 125 to 44, similar to the 223 to 86 ratio in 2012.</p>
