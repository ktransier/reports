  <span class="label label-primary label-tldr">SUMMARY</span> The frequency of LRA attacks in northeastern Congo has slowly declined in recent years, though they continue to target communities west and south of Garamba National Park. LRA abductions and killings have dropped at a far faster rate than attacks, making it more difficult to distinguish LRA activity from attacks by other armed groups in the area.

<h3 class="page-title-top">I. Steady decline of LRA violence in Congo</h3>
  <div id="A13_Decline" class="visual" style="height: 270px; margin-top: 0px;"></div> 
<p>From 2008-2010, the LRA was one of the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/03/28/dr-congo-lord-s-resistance-army-rampage-kills-321" target="_blank">most violent groups in Congo</a>, killing over 2,300 civilians and abducting nearly 2,500 others. LRA abductions in Congo dropped by 64% and killings by 94% over the next three years, a dramatic drop that reflects the group's dwindling shrinking capacity. However, LRA attacks dropped by only 12% over the same time period, indicating that the decrease in abductions and killings was in part the result of a strategic decision by LRA leaders to order groups reduce extremely violent attacks that attract international attention.</p> 

<p>One trend has been consistent over the past six years: the concentration of LRA attacks in the densely populated farming communities west and south of Congo's Garamba National Park, where the group has maintained a series of semi-permanent camps in the dense forest.</p>

<h3 class="page-title">II. Making a living in the LRA's shadow</h3>
<div id="A13_Livelihood" class="visual" style="height: 270px; margin-top: 0px;"></div>
<p><i>*This graph provides a snapshot of how LRA attacks threaten Congolese civilians engaging in livelihood activities in 2013, though it likely underestimates each category due to lack of detailed information available for many attacks.</i></p>
<p>A vast majority of civilians in LRA-affected areas of Congo rely on access to fields, forests, and rivers to sustain or supplement their livelihoods. Many civilians also travel to local markets to sell their bounty or participate in petty trading. LRA attacks make engaging in these essential livelihoods very dangerous, but many people have little choice but to take the risk.</p> 
<p>Troops from the Congolese army and the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo (MONUSCO) are deployed throughout the region, but do little but deter LRA raids on major towns. Many civilians utilize self protection techniques, such as traveling in groups along roads and to fields, to reduce their vulnerability to LRA attacks.</p>

<h3 class="page-title">III. Armed group tactics converge in northeastern Congo</h3>
<p>High rates of LRA violence in northeastern Congo have further destabilized an area already plagued by poor governance and lawlessness, contributing to an environment that encourages a variety of armed actors to prey on civilians. In particular, Garamba National Park's dense forests and lucrative wild game attract LRA fighters, rogue Congolese soldiers, local poachers, and heavily armed Sudanese and South Sudanese poachers. Using the forest for refuge, these armed groups attack travelers and villages on roads running west and south of the park. 

These armed groups often use tactics similar to the LRA's, sometimes intentionally, making it difficult for protection actors to identify perpetrators. This dynamic has been exacerbated by the LRA's decision to reduce its signature large-scale abduction raids and massacres. In LRA-affected areas of Congo in 2013, the ratio of LRA attacks to those in which the armed group was unidentified (indicating the perpetrator could be the LRA, bandits, poachers, rogue Congolese soldiers, or other armed groups) was 125 to 44, similar to the 223 to 86 ratio in 2012.</p>
