<!-- LRA LOOTINGS -->
<h3 class="page-title">Steady decline of LRA violence in Congo</h3>
<div class="page-subtitle"></div>
<p>From 2008-2010, the LRA was one of the deadliest groups in Congo, killing over 2,300 civilians. LRA violence has steadily declined since then, with only 39 killings in the past two years. One trend has been consisent over the past six years: The concentration of LRA attacks west and south of Congo's Garamba National Park, where the group has maintained a series of semi-permanent camps in the dense forest.</p>

<p>Kenneth, I have a tweak for this graph: two different bar graphs with bars for attacks/killings/abductions, with one graph compiling data from 2008-2010 and the other 2011-2013. The difference will be astonishing.</p>

<!-- DANGEROUS LIVELIHOODS -->
<a name="dangerous-livelihoods" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">Hunting, fishing, and farming in the LRA's shadow</h3>
<div class="page-subtitle"></div>
<p>A vast majority of civilians in LRA-affected areas of Congo rely on access to fields, forests, and rivers to sustain or supplement their livelihoods. Many civilians also travel to local markets to sell their bounty or participate in petty trading. LRA attacks make engaging in these livelihoods very dangerous, but many people have little choice but to take the risk. 

Troops from Congolese army and the United Nations mission to Congo (MONUSCO) are deployed throughout the region, but can do little but deter LRA raids on major towns. Many civilians utilize self protection techniques, such as traveling in groups along roads and to fields, to reduce their vulnerability to LRA attacks.</p>

  <i>This graph provides a snapshot of how LRA attacks threaten Congolese civilians engaging in livelihood activities, though it likely underestimates each category due to lack of detailed information on many attacks.</i>
