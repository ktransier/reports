<!-- LRA COMMAND STRUCTURE -->
<h3 class="page-title">Rumblings in the LRA Command Structure</h3>
<p>LRA founder Joseph Kony remains the undisputed leader of the rebel group, but below him the command hierarchy is flat and in constant flux. This is largely a function of Kony's decisions to rapidly promote or demote officers, often disregarding their conventional military rank, to ensure no commander attains enough influence to threaten his iron grip on the LRA. In recent years, Kony has tended to promote younger commanders, many of them abducted as young boys from northern Ugandan who then served as his bodyguards and remain fiercely loyal to him. Kony has also given more power to several of his sons, including Salim, who was raised in the bush and reportedly is seeking more influence within the LRA. Meanwhile, Kony has demoted many older commanders who had military experience before joining the LRA, though his loyal second-in-command, Okot Odhiambio, retains a position of great influence.</p> 

<p>However, Kony's attempts to maintain his hold on power have come at significant risk and cost. He has authorized greater use of High-Frequency (HF) radios in order to maintain communications with far-flung LRA commanders, despite the danger that Ugandan military forces will use HF signal intercepts to track down LRA groups. Despite such attempts to retain control, Kony reportedly executed four LRA officers for disobedience in 2013, in addition to three others in late 2012. The most notable execution was of Otto Agweng, once one of Kony's most feared and trusted enforcers, who was reportedly executed in early 2013 after he slept with a female captive against Kony's orders.</p> 

<p>Kony's discinplinary actions, like his decisions on the command hierarchy, can be unpredictable. Kony's half-brother, David Olanya, was also incurred Kony's wrath for sleeping with a female captive without permission. However, Kony only demoted him, perhaps in deference to his family ties. Dominic Ongwen has also escaped the full force of Kony's justice despite incurring his wrath, likely due to his family ties to Kony and bravery in battle.</p>

<div class="page-subtitle"> Kony the Grandmaster: LRA resupply networks take advantage of regional discord</div>
<p>LRA commanders and counter-LRA forces are locked into a complex chess match, with each seeking to gain the upper hand. In recent years the LRA has proved especially adept at taking advantage of regional discord and and instability as counter-LRA forces struggled to adapt. Kony exploited political tensions between Sudan and Uganda to acquire safe haven from the AU RTF (UPDF) in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi territory from late 2012 until early 2013. LRA forces staying in bases there (#X) received limited amounts of food and other supplies from Sudanese troops, and also traded basic goods at nearby markets in South Darfur such as Sango (#X).</p> 

<p>In Congo, LRA forces have also exploited tensions between Congo and Uganda, which has prevented AU RTF (UPDF) forces from officially operating in Congo since 2011. With Congolese troops and UN peacekeepers posing little threat, the LRA established several semi-permanent camps, one in Garamba National Park (#X) and another in remote Bas Uele district (#x). These camps served as rear supply bases from which food, uniforms, and other goods looted in Congo, as well as ivory poached from Garamba's elephants, was sent to LRA commanders in CAR and Kafia Kingi. LRA forces also transported ivory poached from endangered elephants to CAR and Kafia Kingi, where some where traded to Sudanese dealers. The LRA's Congo bases included fields used for crop cultivation and also served as safe sites for women, children, fighters too weak or injured to keep up with more mobile LRA groups in CAR. </p>

<p>LRA forces also took advantage of the beseiged ex-Seleka government in CAR. In August 2013, an LRA group led by Otto Ladeere set up a series of camps near the town of Nzako in Haut Kotto district from which they established contact with CAR transitional authorities. In an attempt to build trust with the group, CAR officials led by General Demane sent food and rope to the LRA group, while a national aid group provided additional food and medical supplies. Despite promises to come out of the bush, contact was eventually lost with Ladeere's group and LRA groups reportedly left their bases. LRA groups also committed their most violent and lucrative raids in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka forces, knowing they faced little chance of reprisal.</p>

<div class="page-subtitle">The AU RTF strikes back</div>
<p>Despite the LRA's skillful exploitation of regional insecurity, the AU RTF made notable progress in weakening the LRA in 2013. In January, AU RTF (UPDF) troops in CAR killed Binany Okumu, one of Kony's most loyal advisers, whom Kony had entrusted with valuable ivory deliveries. In March, AU RTF (UPDF) troops circumvented Sudanese troops to destroy an LRA base in Kafia Kingi, missing Kony just days after he left for CAR. However, just after the raid the Seleka coup in CAR forced the AU RTF to put operations on hold, giving Kony new breathing space.</p>

<p>In September, AU RTF operations gained new momentum. In late September, AU RTF (Congo) and AU RTF (South Sudan) forces conducted their first offensive operations against the LRA, benefiting from substantial US logistical and intelligence support. AU RTF (South Sudan) troops struck first, moving south into Congo's Garamba National Park to destroy several LRA bases and crops there. Days later, AU RTF (Congo) troops destroyed the LRA's base in Bas Uele district, as well as several acres of fields and racks of drying fish.</p>

<p>Within weeks, the UPDF announced the official resumption of counter-LRA operations in CAR. In their first major operational success since March, they killed LRA commander Samuel Kangul on November XX, reportedly recovering some of the supplies the group had attained from CAR authorities near Nzako.</p>
