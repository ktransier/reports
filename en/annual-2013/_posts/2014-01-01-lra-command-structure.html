  <h3 class="page-title">Rumblings in the LRA Command Structure</h3>


<p>LRA founder Joseph Kony remains the undisputed leader of the rebel group, but below him the command hierarchy is flat and in constant flux. This is largely a function of Kony's decisions to rapidly promote or demote officers, often disregarding their conventional military rank, to ensure no commander attains enough influence to threaten his iron grip on the LRA. In recent years, Kony has tended to promote younger commanders, many of them abducted as young boys from northern Ugandan who served as his bodyguards and are fiercely loyal to him. Kony has also given more power to several of his sons, including Salim, who was raised in the bush and reportedly is seeking more influence within the LRA. Meanwhile, Kony has demoted many older commanders who had military experience before joining the LRA, though his loyal second-in-command, Okot Odhiambio, retains a position of great influence.</p> 

<p>However, Kony's attempts to maintain his hold power have come at significant risk and cost. Kony has authorized greater use of High-Frequency (HF) radios in order to maintain communications with far-flung LRA commanders, despite the danger that Ugandan military forces will use HF signal intercepts to track down LRA groups. Despite such attempts to retain control, Kony reportedly executed four LRA officers for disobedience in 2013, in addition to three others in late 2012. The most notable execution was of Otto Agweng, once one of Kony's most feared and trusted enforcers, who was reportedly executed in early 2013 after he slept with a female captive against Kony's orders. Kony also demoted his half-brother, David Olanya, for a similar transgression.</p>
