Rumblings in the ranks: LRA command structure dynamics
  <h3 class="page-title"></h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>
<p>LRA founder Joseph Kony remains the undisputed leader of the rebel group, but below him the command hierarchy is flat and in constant flux. This is largely a function of Kony's decisions to rapidly promote or demote officers, often disregarding their conventional military rank, to ensure no commander attains enough influence to threaten his iron grip on the LRA. In recent years, Kony has tended to promote younger commanders, many of them abducted as young boys from northern Ugandan who served as bodyguards to Kony and are fiercely loyal to him. Kony has also given more power to several of his sons, including Salim, who was raised in the bush and reportedly has high ambitions for rising within the LRA's ranks. Meanwhile, Kony has demoted many older commanders who had military experience before joining the LRA, though his loyal second-in-command, Okot Odhiambio, retains a position of great influence. 

However, Kony's attempts to maintain his hold power can come at great cost and risk. Kony reportedly executed four LRA officers in 2013, including Otto Agweng, once one of Kony's most feared and trusted enforcers. Agweng was reportedly executed after he slept with a female captive against Kony's, as were three additional LRA officers executed in late 2012.
