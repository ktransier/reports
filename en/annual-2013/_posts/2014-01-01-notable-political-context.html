  <p>Ugandan troops operating in southeast CAR under the authority of the AU RTF officially suspended counter-LRA operations following the March 2013 coup. Tensions between the new Central African authorities and Ugandan troops spiked after Djotodia threatened to send Seleka troops to Ugandan-controlled territory following an unsuccessful attack on the town of Obo by a new armed group. However, in June 2013, Djotodia signed a statement reaffirming his support of the AU RTF and permitting Ugandan troops to resume operations against the LRA. Both the AU Peace and Security Council and UN Security Council have also encouraged the Ugandan military to resume operations. The Ugandan government has yet to officially announce it has resumed operations, but is reportedly planning to do so.<p></p>
