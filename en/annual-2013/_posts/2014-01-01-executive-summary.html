  <h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary: The 6 most important LRA trends of 2013</h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">3. The AU RTF reduced the LRA's access to safe havens</div>

In early 2013, senior LRA commanders had access to a network of safe havens across Congo, CAR, and the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave in which they could operate free of military pressure. In March and April 2013, Ugandan AU RTF troops destroyed several LRA bases in the Kafia Kingi enclave where LRA troops had been receiving limited supplies from Sudanese (SAF) troops. In September 2013, South Sudanese (SPLA) and Congolese (FARDC) AU RTF troops destroyed two LRA camps in Congo in the first offensive operations against LRA troops in over two years.

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">4. The LRA conducted most violent attacks in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels</div>
LRA forces committed XX% of their most violent attacks in 2013 in areas of Mbomou and Haut Kotto prefectures in CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels. These included XX attacks in which the LRA abducted over XX people. The LRA only abducted over XX people in XX attacks in Congo and areas of CAR in which AU RTF forces are based. This pattern was consistent with 2012, in which XX% of the LRA's most violent attacks occurred in Mbomou and Haut Kotto.

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">5. At least XX% of the LRA's Congolese victims were engaged in livelihood activities when attacked</div>

A vast majority of civilians in LRA-affected areas of Congo rely on access to fields, forests, and rivers to sustain or supplement their livelihoods. Many civilians also travel to local markets to sell their bounty or participate in petty trading. LRA attacks make engaging in these livelihoods very dangerous, but many people have little choice but to take the risk.

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">6. Most LRA abductees were adults used as porters</div>

In 2013, XX% of LRA abductees were adults who escaped or were released within 30 days, while only XX% where children who stayed with the LRA for three months or more. This trend suggests that instead of seeking to abduct young children and train them as new fighters, the LRA is in need of strong adults capable of carrying heavy loads of looted goods.
