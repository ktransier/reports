<!-- LRA CAMPS -->
<a name="lra-camps" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">I. LRA camps and resupply networks</h3>
<p>LRA commanders and counter-LRA forces are locked into a complex chess match, with LRA commanders skillfully taking advantage of regional instability as counter-LRA forces try to adapt. Most notably, Kony exploited political tensions between Sudan and Uganda to acquire safe haven from Ugandan RTF forces in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi territory from late 2012 until early 2013. LRA forces staying in camps there (#XX) received limited amounts of food and other supplies from Sudanese troops, and also traded basic goods at nearby markets in South Darfur such as Sango (#XX).</p>

<p>In Congo, LRA forces have also exploited tensions between Congo and Uganda, which has prevented Ugandan RTF forces from officially operating in Congo since 2011. With Congolese troops and UN peacekeepers posing little threat, the LRA established several semi-permanent camps in Garamba National Park (#XX) and in remote Bas Uele district (#XX). These camps served as rear supply bases from which food, uniforms, and other goods looted in Congo, as well as ivory poached from Garamba's elephants, was sent to LRA commanders in CAR and Kafia Kingi. LRA forces also transported ivory poached from endangered elephants to CAR and Kafia Kingi, where some was traded to Sudanese dealers. The LRA's Congo bases included fields used for crop cultivation and also served as safe sites for women, children, fighters too weak or injured to keep up with more mobile LRA groups in CAR.</p>

<p>LRA forces also took advantage of the beseiged transitional government in CAR. Throughout 2013, groups <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/car/LRA">committed their most violent and lucrative raids in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka forces</a>, knowing they faced little chance of reprisal. In August 2013, an LRA group led by Otto Ladeere set up a series of camps near the town of Nzako in Haut Kotto district (#XX) from which they established contact with former Central African transitional leader Michel Djotodia. In an attempt to build trust with the group, Djotodia authorized a trusted ally, General Demane, to send food and rope to the LRA group. A national aid group provided additional food and medical supplies. Despite promises to come out of the bush, contact was eventually lost with Ladeere and the LRA groups reportedly left their bases.</p>

<!-- LOOTING ANALYSIS -->

<h3 class="page-title">II. LRA looting patterns</h3>
<p>Though LRA forces took advantage of external support from Central African officials and the Sudanese military when possible, most groups continued to rely on small-scale looting raids to sustain their day-to-day needs. LRA attack patterns in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels indicate the group is still capable of mounting massive attacks when needed, but no attacks in 2013 resembled historical LRA recruitment raids in which they abducted large numbers of children to be trained as long-term soldiers, wives, and camp labor.</p>

<p>The following visualizations of LRA looting patterns highlight the group's continued tranformation from a powerful rebel group into a collection of small bands whose modus operandi resembles that of common bandits, with the exception of periodic large-scale raids in CAR.</p>
