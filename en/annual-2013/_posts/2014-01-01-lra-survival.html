<p>LRA commanders and counter-LRA forces are locked into a complex chess match, with LRA commanders skillfully taking advantage of regional instability as counter-LRA forces try to adapt.</p>

<p><b>Sudanese safe haven:</b> LRA forces have periodically established camps in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi territory, with <a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/04/report-sudans-renewed-support-to-the-lra/" target="_blank">Kony himself staying in Kafia Kingi</a> in late 2012 and early 2013. Sudanese troops there provided LRA forces there with safe haven from Ugandan RTF troops and small amounts of food and other supplies.</p> 

<p><b>Exploiting negotiations:</b> In August 2013, an LRA group led by Otto Ladeere set up a series of camps near the town of Nzako in CAR's Haut Kotto district. From there they established contact with local authorities and former Central African transitional leader Michel Djotodia. In an attempt to build trust with the group and encourage their defection, Djotodia authorized a trusted ally, General Demane, <a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/11/the-backstory-on-konys-surrender-talks/" target="_blank">to send food and rope to the LRA group</a>. A national aid group provided additional food and medical supplies. Despite promises to come out of the bush, contact was eventually lost with Ladeere and the LRA groups reportedly left their bases.</p>

<p><b>Poaching and ivory trafficking:</b> In mid-2011, Kony ordered LRA groups to kill elephants and bring him ivory. In late 2012, senior commander Binany Okumu travelled from Congo's Garamba National Park to Kony's camp in Kafia Kingi with as many as 38 tusks, though it is unclear if he delivered all of them. The final destination of the LRA's ivory is not known, though reports indicate it some has been traded to Sudanese troops or Arab businessmen.</p>

<p><b>Trading:</b> LRA forces in Kafia Kingi have periodically travelled to market towns such as Songo to barter and purchase goods, though they likely had stopped doing so by mid-2013. Recent LRA defectors also report that they go through local middleman, often Mbororo herders, to obtain medical supplies and other goods.</p>

<p><b>Hunting, fishing, and farming:</b> The LRA has utilized a network of camps in Congo since 2005, with clusters concentrated in Garamba National Park and in the remote Bas Uele district. LRA groups in these areas fished and hunted elephants and hippos, drying the meat on racks. They also grow crops such as beans, sim sim, and maize. The camps also contained huts, including separate buildings for storing food. AU RTF forces <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-force-capacity/" target="_blank">destroyed several of these camps</a> in September 2013, and it is unclear if the LRA groups currently occupy camps in Congo. LRA forces also cultivated crops in Kafia Kingi from 2011 through at least early 2013.</p>
  
<p><b>Internal resupply routes:</b> The LRA's camps in Congo have served as rear supply bases from which supplies obtained in Congo were sent to LRA commanders in CAR and Kafia Kingi. LRA forces also transported ivory poached from endangered elephants to CAR and Kafia Kingi, where some was traded to Sudanese dealers.  served as safe sites for women, children, and fighters too weak or injured to keep up with more mobile LRA groups in CAR.</p>

<p><b>Looting:</b> most groups continued to rely on small-scale looting raids to sustain their day-to-day needs. Throughout 2013, groups <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/car/#mass">committed their most violent and lucrative raids in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka forces</a>, knowing they faced little chance of reprisal from AU RTF forces.</p>

<!-- LOOTING ANALYSIS -->
<a name="looting-analysis" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">II. LRA looting patterns</h3>
<p>The expansion of civilian early warning networks in LRA-affected areas in recent years has shed greater light on patterns in LRA attacks, including what they loot and what happens to people they abduct. LRA attack patterns in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels indicate the group is still capable of mounting massive attacks when needed, but no attacks in 2013 resembled historical LRA recruitment raids in which they abducted large numbers of children to be trained as long-term soldiers, wives, and camp labor.</p>

<p>The following visualizations of LRA looting patterns highlight the group's continued tranformation from a powerful rebel group into a collection of small bands whose modus operandi resembles that of common bandits, with the exception of periodic large-scale raids in CAR.</p>
