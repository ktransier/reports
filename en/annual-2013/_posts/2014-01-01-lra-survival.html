  <span class="label label-primary label-tldr">SUMMARY</span> The LRA has utilized a range of survival strategies in recent years, including obtaining external assistance from regional government officials, farming, and trafficking ivory. However, most LRA groups rely primarily on looting small communities, with attack patterns suggesting most abductees are used as short-term porters.

<h3 class="page-title-top">I. LRA camps and resupply routes</h3>
<p>LRA commanders have established a sophisticated network of camps, resupply routes, and even collaborators, crisscrossing porous borders in remote regions well aware that AU RTF and UN peacekeeping forces often are unable to follow them. The map and narrative below provide more detail on how the LRA survived in 2012 and 2013, highlighting their adaptability to diverse political and ecological environments.</p>

<p><b>Sudanese safe haven:</b> LRA forces have periodically established camps in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi territory since 2010, with <a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/04/report-sudans-renewed-support-to-the-lra/" target="_blank">Kony himself staying in Kafia Kingi</a> in late 2012 and early 2013. Sudanese troops there provided LRA forces there with safe haven from Ugandan RTF troops and small amounts of food, ammunition, and other supplies.</p> 

<p><b>Exploiting negotiations:</b> In August 2013, an LRA group led by Otto Ladeere set up a camp near the town of Nzako in CAR's Haut Kotto district and established contact with local authorities and former Central African transitional leader Michel Djotodia. In an attempt to build trust with the group and encourage their defection, Djotodia authorized a trusted ally, General Damane, <a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/11/the-backstory-on-konys-surrender-talks/" target="_blank">to send food and rope to the LRA group</a>. A national aid group provided additional food and medical supplies. Despite promises to come out of the bush, contact was eventually lost with Ladeere and the LRA groups reportedly left their bases.</p>

<p><b>Poaching and ivory trafficking:</b> In mid-2011, Kony ordered LRA groups to <a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/07/new-report-how-to-dismantle-the-lra-from-the-bottom-up/" target="_blank">kill elephants and bring him ivory</a>. In late 2012, senior commander Binany Okumu travelled from Congo's Garamba National Park to Kony's camp in Kafia Kingi with as many as 38 tusks, though it is unclear if he delivered all of them. The ivory's final destination is unclear, though LRA defectors report some has been traded to Sudanese troops or Arab businessmen.</p>

<p><b>Trading:</b> LRA forces in Kafia Kingi have periodically travelled to market towns such as Songo to barter and purchase goods, though they likely had stopped doing so by mid-2013. Recent defectors also report that LRA groups sometimes use local middlemen, often Mbororo herders, to obtain medical supplies and other goods.</p>

<p><b>Hunting, fishing, and farming:</b> The LRA has utilized a network of camps in Congo since 2005, with clusters concentrated in Garamba National Park and in the remote Bas Uele district. LRA groups there fished and hunted elephants and hippos, drying the meat on racks. They also grew crops such as beans, sim sim, and maize. The camps contained huts, including separate buildings for storing food, and served as secure sites for women, children, and injured fighters. AU RTF forces <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-force-capacity/" target="_blank">destroyed several of these camps</a> in September 2013, and it is unclear if the LRA groups currently occupy camps in Congo. LRA forces also cultivated crops in Kafia Kingi from 2011 through at least early 2013.</p>
  
<p><b>Internal resupply routes:</b> The LRA's camps in Congo have served as rear supply bases from which food, ammunition, and other supplies obtained in Congo were sent to LRA commanders in CAR and Kafia Kingi. Kony specifically requested motorcyle batteries (used for charging electronics) and ivory be sent to senior LRA commanders surrounding him. LRA forces use a complex system of coded High Frequency (HF) radio communications, runners, and preset rendezvous points to coordinate the safe transfer of goods across the group's vast operational theater.</p>

<p><b>Looting:</b> Most LRA groups continue to rely on small-scale looting raids to sustain their day-to-day needs. Throughout 2013, groups <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/car/#mass">committed their most violent and lucrative raids</a> in areas of CAR under the authority of ex-Seleka forces, knowing they faced little chance of reprisal from AU RTF forces.</p>

<!-- LOOTING ANALYSIS -->
<a name="looting-analysis" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">II. LRA looting patterns</h3>
<p>The expansion of civilian early warning networks in LRA-affected areas in recent years has shed greater light on patterns in LRA attacks, including what they loot and what happens to the people they abduct. LRA attack patterns in CAR indicate the group is still capable of mounting massive attacks when needed, but no attacks in 2013 resembled historical LRA recruitment raids in which they abducted large numbers of children to be trained as long-term soldiers, wives, and camp labor.</p>

<p>The following visualizations of LRA looting patterns highlight the group's tranformation from a powerful rebel force into a group whose modus operandi resembles that of common bandits, with the exception of periodic large-scale raids in CAR.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 50px; text-align: right">The most commonly reported looted food was groundnuts, an ideal food for mobile LRA groups due to its durability, high calorie and protein counts, and ease of transport.</p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p style="margin-top: 0px; text-align: right">The LRA abducted four or fewer people in a vast majority of its 2013 attacks, indicating they are not rebuilding their fighting capacity but are using abductees primarily as porters for looted goods after small-scale raids. Ten of the 13 attacks in which the LRA abducted 10 or more people occurred in areas of CAR under the authority of ex-Seleka rebels, even though they comprise just a small fraction of the LRA's total area of operation.</p>
