<h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary: The 6 most important LRA trends of 2013</h3>

<div class="row row-alt">
  <div class="page-subtitle">1. The LRA lost between 11%&ndash;18% of its core fighting capacity</div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>The greatest structural weaknesses facing the Lord's Resitance Army (LRA) is its inability to replace Ugandan commanders and fighters, as the group can no longer recruit in Uganda and has been unable to promote non-Ugandans into command positions. In 2013, 16 Ugandan male combatants defected from the LRA, xx of whom were encouraged to defect by Come Home defection messaging. Another six Ugandan combatants, including four senior officers, were confirmed killed or captured in 2013. Unconfirmed reports indicate that</p>

    <p>the Ugandan military forces operating with the African Union Regional Task Force (AU RTF-UPDF) captured or killed approximately 15 additional Ugandan LRA fighters. In total, the LRA lost between between 11%&ndash;18% of the approximately 200 Ugandan male officers and fighters in its ranks at the beginning of 2013. Combined with the 20 confirmed Ugandan male defectors in 2012, the LRA has lost as much as one-fourth of its Ugandan combatant core in the past two years.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">2. LRA commanders are losing the captives they depend on most</div>
  <hr>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>62 women and children who had spent at least six months in LRA captivity returned home in 2013, comprising a significant portion of the experienced labor that senior LRA commanders rely on to sustain day-to-day life in the bush. A vast majority (73%) of which were either released by LRA combatants or escaped with defecting LRA combatants. The most notable such incidents were the LRA's release of 28 women and children in March 2013 and the escape of 10 women and children who accompanied LRA commander Lt. Okello Okutti's defecting group in December 2013.</p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>In recent years, senior LRA commanders <a href=“http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-survival/”>established safe havens across the region</a>, including semi-permanent camps in Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo) from which they illegally poached ivory and camps in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave where they bartered the ivory and received limited supplies from </p>

    <p>Sudanese troops. In late 2013, LRA forces claiming to negotiate Kony's surrender even convinced transitional authorities in Central African Republic (CAR) to provdide them with rope, food, and medical supplies.<a href=“http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-force-capacity/”>In response</a>, AU-UPDF troops secretly destroyed the LRA's Kafia Kingi camps in early 2013, and recovered supplies provided</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">4. LRA attacks and abductions in Congo dropped by nearly 50%</div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>LRA violence in Congo declined for the fourth consecutive year, with a attacks dropping 44% and abductions dropping 47% from 2012 to 2013. The LRA's 16 killings in Congo was slightly higher than the 13 recorded in 2012, but far below the LRA's peak of 1,053 killings in 2009. However, over 255,000 Congolese remained displaced by LRA violence at the end of 2013, a 27% drop from December 2012, indicating LRA violence is severe enough to prevent many civilians from returning home.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">5. The LRA conducted its most violent attacks in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels</div>
  <hr>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>Unlike trends in Congo, LRA violence in CAR was at its highest point since 2010. LRA abductions in CAR rose from 228 in 2012 to 253 in 2013, while killings rose from 38 to 57. In particular, LRA forces committed their most violent attacks in 2013 in areas of Mbomou and Haut Kotto prefectures in CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels where AU RTF forces had</p>

    <p> limited capacity to access. These attacks included 10 attacks in which the LRA abducted over 10 people, compared to only four such attacks in areas of Congo, South Sudan, and CAR in which AU RTF forces regularly operate. In total, 45% all LRA abductions in 2013 occurred in areas controlled by ex-Seleka rebels.</p>
