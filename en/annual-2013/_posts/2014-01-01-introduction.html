<h3 class="page-title-top" style="margin-top: 20px">Executive Summary: The 5 most important LRA trends of 2013</h3>
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) attacks and abductions continued to decline in 2013, hitting their lowest levels since 2008, and military operations and defections significantly weakened the group's fighting capacity. The notable exceptions to these trends were a resurgence of large-scale LRA looting raids in areas of CAR under the authoiry of ex-Seleka rebels and the first LRA attacks in South Sudan since 2011. 
<div class="row row-alt">
  <div class="page-subtitle">1. The LRA lost as much as one-fifth 16%&ndash;21% of its core fighting capacity</div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>The LRA's greatest structural weaknesses is its inability to replace the male Ugandan combatants that comprise the core of its command structure and fighting capacity. In 2013, <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-force-capacity/">16 Ugandan combatants defected</a> from the LRA and another 12, including four senior officers, were confirmed killed or captured. Ugandan troops operating under the African Union Regional Task Force (AU RTF) may have also captured or killed as many as 11 additional fighters.</p>
    <p>In total, the LRA has lost 32&ndash;43 (16%&ndash;21%) of the estimated 200 Ugandan officers and fighters that were in its ranks at the beginning of 2013.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">2. LRA commanders are losing the captives they depend on most</div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>Sixty-two women and children who had spent at least six months in LRA captivity <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-force-capacity/#returnees">returned home in 2013</a>, a significant portion of the experienced labor that senior LRA commanders rely on to sustain day-to-day life in the bush. A vast majority (73%) either escaped with defecting LRA combatants or were released by LRA fighters, including 28 women and children released in a single incident in March 2013.</p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>In recent years, senior LRA commanders <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-survival/">established safe havens</a> across the region, including semi-permanent camps in Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo) from which they illegally poached ivory and camps in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave where they bartered the ivory and received limited supplies from Sudanese</p>

In late 2013, LRA forces claiming to negotiate Kony's surrender even convinced transitional authorities in Central African Republic (CAR) to provide them with rope, food, and medical supplies.</p><p><a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-force-capacity/">In response</a>, AU-UPDF troops secretly destroyed the LRA's Kafia Kingi camps in early 2013, and</p>

    <p>recovered supplies provided by CAR officials in a raid on an LRA group that abandoned the "negotiations" in November 2013. In September 2013, South Sudanese (SPLA) and Congolese (FARDC) AU RTF troops destroyed two LRA camps in Congo in the first offensive operations against LRA troops in over two years.</p>

    <p>LRA violence in Congo <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/congo/">declined for the fourth consecutive year</a>, with attacks dropping 44% and abductions dropping 47% from 2012 to 2013. The number of Congolese civilians displaced by LRA violence dropped, though less dramatically (27% between 2012 and 2013), indicating LRA violence remains severe enough to prevent many civilians from returning home.</p>

    <p>Unlike trends in Congo, <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/car/#mass">LRA violence in CAR increased</a> to its highest point since 2010. This trend was driven by the abduction of over 200 people in a series of particularly violent attacks in areas under the authority of ex-Seleka rebels where AU RTF forces have limited access.</p>
