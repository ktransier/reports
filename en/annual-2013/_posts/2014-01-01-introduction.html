<h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary: The 6 most important LRA trends of 2013</h3>

<div class="row row-alt">
  <div class="page-subtitle">1. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) lost between 11%&ndash;18% of its core fighting capacity</div>

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>The LRA's greatest structural weaknesses is its inability to replace the male Ugandan combatants that comprise the core of its fighting capacity. In 2013, 16 Ugandan combatants defected from the LRA and another 12, including four senior officers, were confirmed killed or captured. Ugandan troops operating under the African Union Regional Task Force (AU RTF) may have also captured or killed as many as 11 additional fighters.</p>
    <p>In total, the LRA has lost between between 14%&ndash;19% of the approximately 200 Ugandan officers and fighters in its ranks at the beginning of 2013, and as much as one-fourth of its Ugandan combatant core in the past two years.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">2. LRA commanders are losing the captives they depend on most</div>
  <hr>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>62 women and children who had spent at least six months in LRA captivity returned home in 2013, a significant portion of the experienced labor that senior LRA commanders rely on to sustain day-to-day life in the bush. A vast majority (73%) either escaped with defecting LRA combatants or were released by LRA fighters, including 28 women and children released in single incident in March 2013.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">3. The AU RTF severely disrupted the LRA's supply networks and safe havens</div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>In recent years, senior LRA commanders <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-survival/">established safe havens across the region</a>, including semi-permanent camps in Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo) from which they illegally poached ivory and camps in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave where they bartered the ivory and received limited supplies from </p>

    <p>Sudanese troops. In late 2013, LRA forces claiming to negotiate Kony's surrender even convinced transitional authorities in Central African Republic (CAR) to provdide them with rope, food, and medical supplies.</p><p><a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/lra-force-capacity/">In response</a>, AU-UPDF troops secretly destroyed the LRA's Kafia Kingi camps in early 2013, and recovered supplies provided</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">4. LRA attacks and abductions in Congo dropped by nearly 50%</div>

    <p>LRA violence in Congo declined for the fourth consecutive year, with attacks dropping 44% and abductions dropping 47% from 2012 to 2013. The number of Congolese civilians displaced by LRA violence dropped, though less dramatically (27% between 2012 and 2013), indicating LRA violence remains severe enough to prevent many civilians from returning home.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">5. The LRA conducted its most violent attacks in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels</div>
  <hr>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Unlike trends in Congo, LRA violence in CAR rose to its highest point since 2010. LRA forces were especially violent in areas controlled by ex-Seleka rebels where AU RTF forces have limited access, committing 10 attacks there in which they abducted over 10 people. The LRA abducted 207 people there in 2013, 45% of its total for the entire region.</p>
