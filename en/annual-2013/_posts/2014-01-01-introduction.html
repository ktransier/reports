<h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary: The 6 most important LRA trends of 2013</h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>
  <div class="page-subtitle">1. The LRA lost between 11%&ndash;18% of its fighting capacity</div>
  
  <p>The greatest structural weaknesses facing the Lord's Resitance Army (LRA) is its inability to replace Ugandan commanders and fighters, as the group can no longer recruit in Uganda and has been unable to promote non-Ugandans into command positions. In 2013, 16 Ugandan male combatants defected from the LRA, xx of whom were encouraged to defect by Come Home defection messaging. Another six Ugandan combatants, including four senior officers, were confirmed killed or captured in 2013. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the Ugandan military forces operating with the African Union Regional Task Force (AU RTF-UPDF) captured or killed approximately 15 additional Ugandan LRA fighters.</p> 
  
<p>In total, the LRA lost between between 11%&ndash;18% of the approximately 200 Ugandan male fighters in its ranks at the beginning of 2013. Combined with the 20 confirmed Ugandan male defectors in 2012, the LRA has lost as much as one-fourth of its fighting capacity in the past two years.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">2. At least 62 of the LRA's long-term women and children captives returned home</div>
  
  <p>62 women and children who had spent at least six months in LRA captivity returned home in 2013, a vast majority (73%) of which were either released by LRA combatants or escaped with defecting LRA combatants. The most notable such incidents were the LRA's release of 28 women and children in March 2013 and the escape of 10 women and children who accompanied LRA commander Lt. Okello Okutti's defecting group in December 2013.</p>

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">3. The AU RTF severely disrupted the LRA's supply networks and safe havens</div>

  <p>In recent years, senior LRA commanders established safe havens across the region, including semi-permanent camps in Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo) from which they illegally poached ivory and camps in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave where they bartered the ivory and received limited supplies from Sudanese troops. In late 2013, LRA forces claiming to negotiate Kony's surrender even convinced transitional authorities in Central African Republic (CAR) to provdide them with rope, food, and medical supplies. 
  
In response, AU-UPDF troops secretly destroyed the LRA's Kafia Kingi camps in early 2013, and recovered supplies provided by CAR officials in    In September 2013, South Sudanese (SPLA) and Congolese (FARDC) AU RTF troops destroyed two LRA camps in Congo in the first offensive operations against LRA troops there in over two years.     

Even so, AU RTF forces succeeded in disrupting many of the LRA's supply networks and safe havens. In March and April 2013, AU-UPDF troops destroyed several LRA bases in the Kafia Kingi enclave in early 2013, and in  In November, Ugandan troops killed </p>

In early 2013, senior LRA commanders had access to a network of safe havens across Congo, CAR, and the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave in which they could operate free of military pressure. In March and April 2013, AU RTF-UPDF troops destroyed several LRA bases in the Kafia Kingi enclave where LRA troops had been bartering illegal ivory poached from Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo) and receiving limited supplies from Sudanese troops. In September 2013, South Sudanese (SPLA) and Congolese (FARDC) AU RTF troops destroyed two LRA camps in Congo in the first offensive operations against LRA troops there in over two years. In November, Ugandan troops killed

    <p><div class="page-subtitle">4. LRA attacks and abductions in Congo dropped by nearly 50%</div>

<p>LRA violence in Congo declined for the fourth consecutive year, with a attacks dropping 44% and abductions dropping 47% from 2012 to 2013. The LRA's 16 killings in Congo was slightly higher than the 13 recorded in 2012, but far below the LRA's peak of 1,053 killings in 2009. However, over 255,000 Congolese remained displaced by LRA violence at the end of 2013, a 27% drop from December 2012, indicating LRA violence is severe enough to prevent many civilians from returning home.</p> 
  
  <p><div class="page-subtitle">5. The LRA conducted most violent attacks in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels</div>
  
  <p>LRA forces committed XX% of their most violent attacks in 2013 in areas of Mbomou and Haut Kotto prefectures in CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels. These included XX attacks in which the LRA abducted over XX people. The LRA only abducted over XX people in XX attacks in Congo and areas of CAR in which AU RTF forces are based. This pattern was consistent with 2012, in which XX% of the LRA's most violent attacks occurred in Mbomou and Haut Kotto.</p>
