<h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary: The 6 most important LRA trends of 2013</h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>
  <div class="page-subtitle">1. The LRA lost between 10%&ndash;17% of its fighting capacity</div>
  
  <p>One of the LRA's greatest structural weaknesses is its inability to replace Ugandan commanders and fighters, as the group can no longer recruit in Uganda and has been unable to promote non-Ugandans into command positions. Three senior LRA commanders were confirmed killed in 2013 and another 17 Ugandan male fighters were confirmed as defected or captured. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Ugandan military forces captured or killed approximately 15 additional LRA fighters. In total, the LRA lost between between 10%&ndash;17% of the approximately 210 Ugandan male fighters in its ranks at the beginning of 2013. Combined with the 20 confirmed Ugandan male defectors in 2012, the LRA has lost between 17%&ndash;24% of its fighting capacity in the past two years.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">2. At least 62 of the LRA's long-term women and children captives returned home</div>
  
  <p>62 women and children who had spent at least six months in LRA captivity returned home in 2013, a vast majority (73%) of which were either released by LRA combatants or escaped with defecting LRA combatants. The most of notable such incidents were the LRA's release of 28 women and children released in March 2013 and the escape of 10 women and children who accompanied LRA commander Lt. Okello Okutti's defecting group in December 2013.</p>

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">3. The AU RTF reduced the LRA's access to safe havens</div>

  <p>In early 2013, senior LRA commanders had access to a network of safe havens across Congo, CAR, and the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave in which they could operate free of military pressure. In March and April 2013, Ugandan AU RTF troops destroyed several LRA bases in the Kafia Kingi enclave where LRA troops had been receiving limited supplies from Sudanese (SAF) troops. In September 2013, South Sudanese (SPLA) and Congolese (FARDC) AU RTF troops destroyed two LRA camps in Congo in the first offensive operations against LRA troops in over two years.</p>

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">4. The LRA conducted most violent attacks in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels</div>
  
  <p>LRA forces committed XX% of their most violent attacks in 2013 in areas of Mbomou and Haut Kotto prefectures in CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels. These included XX attacks in which the LRA abducted over XX people. The LRA only abducted over XX people in XX attacks in Congo and areas of CAR in which AU RTF forces are based. This pattern was consistent with 2012, in which XX% of the LRA's most violent attacks occurred in Mbomou and Haut Kotto.</p>

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">5. LRA violence is slowly dropping in Congo, but increasing in CAR</div>

<p>The total number of LRA attacks and abductions declined  </p>

  <i>This graph provides a snapshot of how LRA attacks threaten Congolese civilians engaging in livelihood activities, though it likely underestimates each category due to lack of detailed information on many attacks. Some persons may be counted in more than one category.</i> 

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">6. Most LRA abductees were adults used as porters</div>

  <p>In 2013, XX% of LRA abductees were adults who escaped or were released within 30 days, while only XX% where children who stayed with the LRA for three months or more. This trend suggests that instead of seeking to abduct young children and train them as new fighters, the LRA is in need of strong adults capable of carrying heavy loads of looted goods.</p>
