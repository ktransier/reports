  <p><div class="page-subtitle">3. The AU RTF reduced the LRA's access to safe havens</div>

  In early 2013, senior LRA commanders had access to a network of safe havens across Congo, CAR, and the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave in which they could operate free of military pressure. In March and April 2013, Ugandan AU RTF troops destroyed several LRA bases in the Kafia Kingi enclave where LRA troops had been receiving limited supplies from Sudanese (SAF) troops. In September 2013, South Sudanese (SPLA) and Congolese (FARDC) AU RTF troops destroyed two LRA camps in Congo in the first offensive operations against LRA troops in over two years.

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">4. The LRA conducted most violent attacks in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels</div>
  
  LRA forces committed XX% of their most violent attacks in 2013 in areas of Mbomou and Haut Kotto prefectures in CAR controlled by ex-Seleka rebels. These included XX attacks in which the LRA abducted over XX people. The LRA only abducted over XX people in XX attacks in Congo and areas of CAR in which AU RTF forces are based. This pattern was consistent with 2012, in which XX% of the LRA's most violent attacks occurred in Mbomou and Haut Kotto.

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">5. At least XX% of the LRA's Congolese victims were engaged in livelihood activities when attacked</div>

  A vast majority of civilians in LRA-affected areas of Congo rely on access to fields, forests, and rivers to sustain or supplement their livelihoods. Many civilians also travel to local markets to sell their bounty or participate in petty trading. LRA attacks make engaging in these livelihoods very dangerous, but many people have little choice but to take the risk.

  <p><div class="page-subtitle">6. Most LRA abductees were adults used as porters</div>

  In 2013, XX% of LRA abductees were adults who escaped or were released within 30 days, while only XX% where children who stayed with the LRA for three months or more. This trend suggests that instead of seeking to abduct young children and train them as new fighters, the LRA is in need of strong adults capable of carrying heavy loads of looted goods.

  <h3 class="page-title">Notable Political Context</h3>

  <div class="page-subtitle"></div>
  <p> <div class="page-subtitle">Crisis in CAR escalates</div>
  <p>After forcefully taking power in CAR in a March 2013 coup with the help of now-disbanded Seleka rebel forces, Central African transitional leader Michael Djotodia lost control of the country in late 2013. November and December 2013 witnessed a surge of often sectarian violence in CAR, primarily perpetrated by ex-Seleka fighters and opposing anti-balaka militias, that has killed over XXX people. France deployed 1,600 troops to help stabilize the country in early December, while African peacekeepers were formally transferred to the African-led International Support Mission for CAR (MISCA) on December 19. However, by the end of 2013 it was unclear how MISCA forces planned to protect civilians in CAR from LRA attacks or cooperate with the AU counter-LRA force (AU RTF).<p> 

  <div class="page-subtitle">M23 rebellion collapses in eastern Congo</div>
  <p>Under pressure from a combined offensive by the Congolese military (FARDC) and UN peacekeepers (MONUSCO) and lacking support from its former backers in Rwanda, the M23 rebellion in eastern Congo collapsed in XXX. The M23 rebellion in eastern Congo collapsed in XXX under pressure from a combined offensive by the Congolese military (FARDC) and UN peacekeepers (MONUSCO). Critical to the collapse was intensified international pressure on Rwanda to halt its support for the M23. However, deep-rooted communal tensions, political marginalization, and violence by other armed groups in the region continues to threaten the prospects for long-term stability.</p>  

  <div class="page-subtitle">Diplomacy paves the way for resumption of AU RTF counter-LRA operations</div>
  <p>Following the March 2013 coup in Bangui, Ugandan troops operating in southeast CAR under the AU RTF's authoirty officially suspended counter-LRA operations following the March 2013 coup. FARDC and South Sudanese military (SPLA) contingents to the AU RTF were also inactive in the first half of 2013, meaning the Ugandan suspension brought counter-LRA operations to a standstill. However, diplomatic efforts by the AU and UN encouraged Djotodia to permit Ugandan troops to resume operations against the LRA, which they officially did in XX 2013. In addition, AU and US diplomats helped secure permission from the Congolese government to allow the SPLA and FARDC contigents to launch counter-LRA operations in northeastern Congo in September 2013.</p>

  <div class="page-subtitle">US government increases support to counter-LRA operations</div>
    <p>In October 2013, President Barack Obama extended the deployment of US military advisers assisting AU RTF forces for a full year, a contrast to previous six-month renewals. The US military also expanded its material support to AU RTF forces, deploying additional airlift and intelligence-gathering assets to the region. In additioned, the US expanded "Come Home" messaging campaigns designed to promote LRA defections by funding the construction of several FM radios in CAR, the deployment helicopter speaker missions, increasing leaflet drops, and operationalizing additaional Safe Reporting Sites in CAR and South Sudan.</p>
