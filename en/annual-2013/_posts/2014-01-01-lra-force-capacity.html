<!-- REDUCTION IN LRA FIGHTING CAPACITY -->
<h3 class="page-title">Reduction in LRA fighting capacity</h3>
<p>Despite the LRA's skillful exploitation of regional insecurity, the AU RTF made notable progress in weakening the LRA in 2013. In January, AU RTF (UPDF) troops in CAR killed Binany Okumu, one of Kony's most loyal advisers, whom Kony had entrusted with valuable ivory deliveries. In March, AU RTF-UPDF troops circumvented Sudanese troops to destroy an LRA base in Kafia Kingi, missing Kony just days after he left for CAR. However, just after the raid the Seleka coup in CAR forced the AU RTF to put operations on hold, giving Kony new breathing space.</p>

<p>In September, AU RTF operations gained new momentum. In late September, AU RTF-FARDC and AU RTF-SPLA forces conducted their first offensive operations against the LRA, benefiting from substantial US logistical and intelligence support. AU RTF-SPLA troops struck first, moving south into Congo's Garamba National Park to destroy several LRA bases and crops there. Days later, AU RTF-FARDC troops destroyed the LRA's base in Bas Uele district, as well as several acres of fields and racks of drying fish. Within weeks, Uganda announced the official resumption of counter-LRA operations in CAR. On November 28, Ugandan troops killed LRA commander Samuel Kangul and recovered some of the supplies the group had attained from CAR authorities near Nzako.</p>

<p>In addition, 16 Ugandan LRA combatants defected from the LRA in 2013. Most notably, senior LRA commander Lt. Col. Okello Okutti surrendered in December 2013 near Tabane, CAR with 5 other Ugandan combatants and 12 others. 7 other Ugandan LRA combatants surrendered in two separate incidents in April 2013 in southeastern CAR.</p>

<p>In total, the LRA lost 25 adult Ugandan male combatants and 6 non-Ugandan adult males, some of whom likely served as low-ranking combatants. Using baseline estimates from The Resolve's August 2013 report Loosening Kony's Grip, the the LRA contained approximately 240 combatants, including an estimated core of 175 Ugandan officers and fighters, by the end of 2013.</p>
