<!-- REDUCTION IN LRA FIGHTING CAPACITY -->
<h3 class="page-title">Reduction in LRA fighting capacity</h3>
<p>Despite the LRA's skillful exploitation of regional insecurity, the AU RTF made notable progress in weakening the LRA in 2013. In January, AU RTF-UPDF troops in CAR killed Binany Okumu, one of Kony's most loyal advisers, whom Kony had entrusted with valuable ivory deliveries. In March, AU RTF-UPDF troops circumvented Sudanese troops to destroy an LRA base in Kafia Kingi, missing Kony just days after he left for CAR. However, just after the raid the Seleka coup in CAR forced the AU RTF to put operations on hold, giving Kony new breathing space.</p>

<p>In September, AU RTF operations gained new momentum. In late September, AU RTF-FARDC and AU RTF-SPLA forces conducted their first offensive operations against the LRA, benefiting from substantial US logistical and intelligence support. AU RTF-SPLA troops struck first, moving south into Congo's Garamba National Park to destroy several LRA bases and crops there. Days later, AU RTF-FARDC troops destroyed the LRA's base in Bas Uele district, as well as several acres of fields and racks of drying fish. Within weeks, Uganda announced the official resumption of counter-LRA operations in CAR. On November 28, Ugandan troops killed LRA commander Samuel Kangul and recovered supplies the group had attained from CAR authorities near Nzako.</p>

<p>In addition, 16 Ugandan LRA combatants defected from the LRA in 2013 and at least one was captured. Most notably, senior LRA commander Lt. Col. Okello Okutti surrendered in December 2013 near Tabane, CAR with 5 other Ugandan combatants and 12 others. 7 other Ugandan LRA combatants surrendered in two separate incidents in April 2013 in southeastern CAR.</p>

<p>In total, the LRA lost at least 22 adult Ugandan male combatants in 2013, with unconfirmed reports indicating AU RTF-UPDF troops killed or captured approximately 15 more. In addition, the LRA lost 6 non-Ugandan adult males who had spent at least six months with the rebel group, indicating they were trained as low-ranking fighters. Using baseline estimates from The Resolve's August 2013 report Loosening Kony's Grip, the the LRA contained approximately 230 combatants, including an estimated core of between 160-180 Ugandan officers and fighters, by the end of 2013.</p>

<p>Kenneth, I'd like the preceding para to wrap around (ie be side by side) with a smaller version of the below bar graph</p>

<!-- LRA COMMAND STRUCTURE -->
<h3 class="page-title">III. LRA command structure</h3>
<p>LRA founder Joseph Kony remains the undisputed leader of the rebel group, but below him the command hierarchy is flat and in constant flux. This is largely a function of Kony's decisions to rapidly promote or demote officers, often disregarding their conventional military rank, to ensure no commander attains enough influence to threaten his iron grip on the LRA. In recent years, Kony has tended to promote younger commanders, many of them abducted as young boys from northern Ugandan who then served as his bodyguards and remain fiercely loyal to him. Kony has also given more power to several of his sons, including Salim, who was raised in the bush and reportedly is seeking more influence within the LRA. Meanwhile, Kony has demoted many older commanders who had military experience before joining the LRA, though his loyal second-in-command, Okot Odhiambio, retains a position of great influence.</p> 
<p>However, Kony's attempts to maintain his hold on power have come at significant risk and cost. He has authorized greater use of High-Frequency (HF) radios in order to maintain communications with far-flung LRA commanders, despite the danger that Ugandan military forces will use HF signal intercepts to track down LRA groups. Despite such attempts to retain control, Kony reportedly executed four LRA officers for disobedience in 2013, in addition to three others in late 2012. The most notable execution was of Otto Agweng, once one of Kony's most feared and trusted enforcers, who was reportedly executed in early 2013 after he slept with a female captive against Kony's orders.</p> 
<p>Kony's discinplinary actions, like his decisions on the command hierarchy, can be unpredictable. Kony's half-brother, David Olanya, was also incurred Kony's wrath for sleeping with a female captive without permission. However, Kony only demoted him, perhaps in deference to his family ties. Dominic Ongwen has also escaped the full force of Kony's justice despite incurring his wrath, likely due to his family ties to Kony and bravery in battle.</p>

<!-- RETURNEES -->
<a name="returnees" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">Return of long-term women and children captives</h3>
<p>While male Ugandan officers keep an iron grip on power within the LRA, they depend on long-term captive women and children to survive on a day-to-day basis. Women and children set up and take down camps, transport camp essentials when groups move, cook, and perform other essential duties. Many women and girl children are forces into sexual relationships with male officers and fighters. Occassionally women participate in looting raids, and a few have become officers.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2013, the LRA had approximately 250 women and children within its ranks, including both long-term captives who had been with the LRA for over six months and short-term abductees. 62 women and children long-term captives escaped the LRA in 2013, a majority (32) of which were children originally abducted from CAR, Congo, or South Sudan. 10 Ugandan women and children escaped the LRA in 2013, a slight reduction from 2012. Nearly 90% of these returnees were intentionally released by the LRA, escaped with an LRA combatant, or were captured by counter-LRA forces, indicating that long-term captives lack opportunities to escape the rebel group on their own.</p>
