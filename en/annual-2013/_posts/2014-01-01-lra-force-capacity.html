<span class="label label-primary label-tldr">SUMMARY</span> AU RTF forces succeeded in destroying several LRA camps and killing key commanders in 2013, while 16 Ugandan LRA combatants and 62 long-term women and children captives defected or escaped. Despite this, Kony retains firm control over the group's command structure and estimated 230 total fighters. 

<!-- REDUCTION IN LRA FIGHTING CAPACITY -->
<h3 class="page-title">I. Reduction in LRA fighting capacity</h3>
<p>In January Ugandan RTF troops in CAR <a href="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/01/21/top-lra-commander-killed-in-combat/" target="_blank">killed Binany Okumu</a>, a Kony loyalist entrusted with ivory deliveries from Congo. In March, Ugandan RTF troops circumvented Sudanese troops to destroy an LRA base in Kafia Kingi, missing Kony just days after he left for CAR. The Seleka coup in CAR then forced the AU RTF to put operations on hold, giving Kony new respite.</p>

<p>In September, operations gained new momentum as South Sudanese and Congolese RTF forces conducted their first offensive action against the LRA utilizing substantial US military logistical and intelligence support. South Sudanese troops destroyed several LRA bases and fields in Congo's Garamba National Park, while Congolese troops destroyed an LRA base in Bas Uele district, including several acres of fields. In November, Ugandan troops <a href ="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/12/02/more-on-the-recent-lra-ambush-in-central-african-republic/" target="_blank">killed LRA commander Samuel Kangul</a> and recovered supplies his group had attained from CAR authorities near Nzako. However, the <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/background/">outbreak of civil war in South Sudan</a> and <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/background/">deteriorating security in CAR</a> have once again put future AU RTF operations in jeopardy.</p>

<p>16 Ugandan LRA combatants defected in 2013. Most notably, <a href="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/12/10/breaking-news-largest-lra-defection-since-2008/" target="_blank">senior LRA commander Lt. Col. Okello Okutti surrendered</a> in December in CAR with five other Ugandan combatants and 12 others. Nine of the Ugandan combatants who defected in 2013 reported being influenced by Come Home defection messaging, including Okutti's group. They cited Acholi-language programs run on the Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC) station <a href="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/09/20/how-opondo-escaped-the-lra-after-15-years/" target="_blank">as particularly influential</a> in encouraging them to defect.</p>

<!-- LRA COMMAND STRUCTURE -->
<a name="lra-command-structure" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">II. LRA command structure</h3>
<p>LRA founder Joseph Kony remains the group's undisputed leader, but below him the command hierarchy is in constant flux. Kony frequently promotes or demotes officers, often disregarding their conventional military rank, to ensure no commander attains enough influence to threaten his iron grip on the LRA. In recent years, Kony has <a href="http://www.lracrisistracker.com/command/evolution" target="_blank">tended to promote younger commanders</a>, many of them abducted as young boys from northern Uganda who then served as his bodyguards and remain fiercely loyal to him. Kony has also reportedly empowered several of his sons, including Salim, an ambitious young officer raised in the bush. Meanwhile, Kony has demoted many older commanders who had military experience before joining the LRA, though his loyal second-in-command, Okot Odhiambo, retains a position of great influence.</p> 

<p>Kony's attempts to maintain his hold on power have come at significant risk and cost. He has authorized greater use of High-Frequency (HF) radios to maintain communications with far-flung LRA commanders, despite the danger that Ugandan military forces will use signal intercepts to track down LRA groups. Kony also reportedly <a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/07/new-report-how-to-dismantle-the-lra-from-the-bottom-up/" target="_blank">ordered the execution of at least four LRA officers</a> for disobedience in late 2012 and early 2013. The most notable execution was of Otto Agweng, once one of Kony's most trusted and feared enforcers, after he raped a female captive against Kony's orders.</p> 

<p>Kony's disciplinary actions, like his decisions on the command hierarchy, can be unpredictable. In 2012, Kony's half-brother David Olanya also incurred Kony's wrath for sleeping with a female captive without permission. However, Kony only demoted him, perhaps in deference to his family ties. Dominic Ongwen has also escaped the full force of Kony's justice, likely due to his family ties to Kony and bravery in battle.</p>

<p>Mapping the LRA's command structure is extremely difficult, given lack of access to the group and Kony's constant reshuffling of responsibilities. This graphic tracks the fates of 101 identified Ugandan officers who were confirmed members of the LRA as of 2009, providing a snapshot of how the command structure has fared since then.</p>

<!-- RETURNEES -->
<a name="returnees" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">III. Return of long-term women and children captives</h3>
<p>While male Ugandan officers keep an iron grip on power within the LRA, they depend on long-term captive women and children to survive on a day-to-day basis. Women and children set up and take down camps, transport camp essentials when groups move, cook, and perform other essential duties. Many women and girls are forced into sexual relationships with male officers and fighters. Occasionally women participate in looting raids, and a few have become officers.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2013, the LRA had approximately 250 women and children within its ranks, including both long-term captives who had been with the LRA for over six months and short-term abductees. Sixty-two women and children long-term captives escaped the LRA in 2013, a majority of which (32) were children originally abducted from CAR, Congo, or South Sudan. Ten Ugandan women and children escaped the LRA in 2013, a slight reduction from the 13 who escaped in 2012. Nearly 75% of the 62 returnees were <a href="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/04/01/update-on-the-28-women-and-children-who-escaped-the-lra-last-week/" target="_blank">intentionally released by the LRA</a> or escaped with an LRA combatant, indicating that the LRA may have trouble feeding women and children and may have less utility for them as the number of combatants dwindles. Only seven of the 62 returnees escaped on their own, suggesting women and children have inadequate information, opportunities, and incentives to escape.</p>
