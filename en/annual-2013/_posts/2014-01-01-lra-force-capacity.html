<!-- REDUCTION IN LRA FIGHTING CAPACITY -->
<h3 class="page-title">I. Reduction in LRA fighting capacity</h3>
<p>Despite the LRA's skillful exploitation of regional insecurity, the AU RTF made notable progress in weakening the LRA in 2013. In January, Ugandan RTF troops in CAR <a href="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/01/21/top-lra-commander-killed-in-combat/">killed Binany Okumu</a>, a Kony loyalist who had been entrusted with valuable ivory deliveries from Congo. In March, Ugandan RTF troops circumvented Sudanese military garrisons to destroy an LRA base in Kafia Kingi, missing Kony just days after he left for CAR. Weeks later, the Seleka coup in CAR forced the AU RTF to put operations on hold, giving Kony new breathing space.</p>

<p>In September, operations gained new momentum as South Sudanese and Congolese RTF forces conducted their first offensive action against the LRA, benefiting from substantial US military logistical and intelligence support. South Sudanese RTF troops destroyed several LRA bases and fields in Congo's Garamba National Park, while Congolese RTF troops destroyed the LRA's base in Bas Uele district, including several acres of fields and racks of drying fish. In November, Ugandan troops <a href ="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/12/02/more-on-the-recent-lra-ambush-in-central-african-republic/">killed LRA commander Samuel Kangul</a> and recovered supplies the group had attained from CAR authorities near Nzako. However, the <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/about/#notable-political-context">outbreak of civil war in South Sudan</a> and <a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013/about/#notable-political-context">deteriorating security in CAR</a> have once again put future AU RTF operations in jeopardy.</p>

<p>In addition, 16 Ugandan LRA combatants defected from the LRA in 2013 and at least one was captured. Most notably, <a href="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/12/10/breaking-news-largest-lra-defection-since-2008/">senior LRA commander Lt. Col. Okello Okutti surrendered</a> in December 2013 near Tabane, CAR with 5 other Ugandan combatants and 12 others. 8 of the Ugandan combatants who defected were influenced by Come Home defection messaging, including the six members of Okutti's group. The Acholi-language shortwave programs run on the Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC) stations were cited by Ugandan defectors <a href="http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2013/09/20/how-opondo-escaped-the-lra-after-15-years/">as particularly influential</a> in encouraging them to defect.</p>

  <p>In total, the LRA lost at least 28 adult Ugandan male combatants in 2013, with unconfirmed reports indicating AU RTF-UPDF troops killed or captured approximately 11 more. In addition, the LRA lost 6 non-Ugandan adult males who had spent at least six months with the rebel group, indicating they were trained as low-ranking fighters. Using baseline estimates from The Resolve's August 2013 report <i><a href="http://www.theresolve.org/2013/07/new-report-how-to-dismantle-the-lra-from-the-bottom-up/">Loosening Kony's Grip</a></i>, the the LRA contained approximately 230 combatants, including an estimated core of between 160-180 Ugandan officers and fighters, by the end of 2013.</p>

<!-- LRA COMMAND STRUCTURE -->
<a name="lra-command-structure" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">II. LRA command structure</h3>
<p>LRA founder Joseph Kony remains the group's undisputed leader, but below him the command hierarchy is in constant flux. Kony frequently promotes or demotes officers, often disregarding their conventional military rank, to ensure no commander attains enough influence to threaten his iron grip on the LRA. In recent years, Kony has tended to promote younger commanders, many of them abducted as young boys from northern Ugandan who then served as his bodyguards and remain fiercely loyal to him. Kony has also reportedly empowered several of his sons, including Salim, an ambitious young officer raised in the bush. Meanwhile, Kony has demoted many older commanders who had military experience before joining the LRA, though his loyal second-in-command, Okot Odhiambio, retains a position of great influence.</p> 
<p>Kony's attempts to maintain his hold on power have come at significant risk and cost. He has authorized greater use of High-Frequency (HF) radios to maintain communications with far-flung LRA commanders, despite the danger that Ugandan military forces will use signal intercepts to track down LRA groups. Kony also reportedly ordered the execution of at least four LRA officers for disobedience in late 2012 and early 2013. The most notable execution was of Otto Agweng, once one of Kony's most feared and trusted enforcers, after he raped a female captive against Kony's orders.</p> 
<p>Kony's discinplinary actions, like his decisions on the command hierarchy, can be unpredictable. In 2012, Kony's half-brother David Olanya also incurred Kony's wrath for sleeping with a female captive without permission. However, Kony only demoted him, perhaps in deference to his family ties. Dominic Ongwen has also escaped the full force of Kony's justice despite incurring his wrath, likely due to his family ties to Kony and bravery in battle.</p>

<p>Graph accompanient text: Mapping the LRA's command structure is extremely difficult, given lack of access to the group and Kony's constant reshuffling of responsibilities. This graphic tracks the fates of 101 identified Ugandan officers who were confirmed members of the LRA as of 2009, providing a snapshot of how the command structure has fared since then.</p>

<!-- RETURNEES -->
<a name="returnees" class="page-anchor"></a>
<h3 class="page-title">III. Return of long-term women and children captives</h3>
<p>While male Ugandan officers keep an iron grip on power within the LRA, they depend on long-term captive women and children to survive on a day-to-day basis. Women and children set up and take down camps, transport camp essentials when groups move, cook, and perform other essential duties. Many women and girl children are forces into sexual relationships with male officers and fighters. Occassionally women participate in looting raids, and a few have become officers.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2013, the LRA had approximately 250 women and children within its ranks, including both long-term captives who had been with the LRA for over six months and short-term abductees. 62 women and children long-term captives escaped the LRA in 2013, a majority (32) of which were children originally abducted from CAR, Congo, or South Sudan. 10 Ugandan women and children escaped the LRA in 2013, a slight reduction from 2012. Nearly 90% of the 62 returnees were intentionally released by the LRA, escaped with an LRA combatant, or were captured by counter-LRA forces, indicating that long-term captives lack opportunities to escape the rebel group on their own.</p>
