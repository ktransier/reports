  <div class="page-subtitle"> Kony the Grandmaster?: LRA resupply networks take advantage of regional discord</div>
  <p>LRA commanders and counter-LRA forces are locked into a complex chess match, with each seeking to gain the upper hand. In recent years the LRA has proved especially adept at taking advantage of regional discord and and instability as counter-LRA forces struggled to adapt. Kony exploited political tensions between Sudan and Uganda to acquire safe haven from the AU RTF (UPDF) in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi territory from late 2012 until early 2013. LRA forces staying in bases there (#X) received limited amounts of food and other supplies from Sudanese troops, and also traded basic goods at nearby markets in South Darfur such as Sango (#X).</p> 
  
<p>In Congo, LRA forces have also exploited tensions between Congo and Uganda, which has prevented AU RTF (UPDF) forces from officially operating in Congo since 2011. With Congolese troops and UN peacekeepers posing little threat, the LRA established several semi-permanent camps, one in Garamba National Park (#X) and another in remote Bas Uele district (#x). These camps served as rear supply bases from which food, uniforms, and other goods looted in Congo, as well as ivory poached from Garamba's elephants, was sent to LRA commanders in CAR and Kafia Kingi. These bases also served as safe sites for women, children, fighters too weak or injured to keep up with more mobile LRA groups in CAR. </p>

<p>LRA forces also took advantage of the beseiged ex-Seleka government in CAR. In August 2013, an LRA group led by Otto Ladeere set up a series of camps near the town of Nzako in Haut Kotto district from which they established contact with CAR transitional authorities. In an attempt to build trust with the group, CAR officials led by General Demane sent food and rope to the LRA group, while a national aid group provided additional food and medical supplies. Despite promises to come out of the bush, contact was eventually lost with Ladeere's group and LRA groups reportedly left their bases. LRA groups also committed their most violent and lucrative raids in areas of CAR controlled by ex-Seleka forces, knowing they faced little chance of reprisal.</p>
