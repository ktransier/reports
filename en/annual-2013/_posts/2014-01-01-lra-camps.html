  <div class="page-subtitle"> Kony the Grandmaster?: LRA resupply networks take advantage of regional discord </div>
  <p>LRA commanders and counter-LRA forces engaged in a complicated chess match in 2013, with each seeking to gain the upper hand. In particular, the LRA proved especially adept at taking advantage of regional discord and and instability as counter-LRA forces struggled to adapt. Kony exploited political tensions between Sudan and Uganda to acquire safe haven from the AU RTF (UPDF) in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi territory from late 2012 until early 2013. 
  
In Congo, LRA forces also exploited tensions between Congo and Uganda, which has prevented AU RTF (UPDF) forces from officially operating in Congo since 2011. With Congolese troops and UN peacekeepers posing little threat, the LRA established several semi-permanent camps in northeast Congo     </p>
