<h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary</h3>
LRA targets communities in close proximity to security forces in both CAR and DRC. However, defections are encouraging. 

<div class="page-subtitle">1. LRA targets Obo-Mboki axis despite Ugandan, US military presence</div>
<p><b><a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/q1-2014/#">1. LRA targets Obo-Mboki axis despite Ugandan, US military presence:</a></b> LRA attacks and abductions surged in CAR’s Haut Mbomou prefecture, despite the presence of Ugandan and US troops that has limited LRA activity there in recent years . The XX LRA attacks and XX abductions, which were concentrated on roads frequently traveled by counter-LRA troops, were the most in a single quarter in Haut Mbomou since early 2010. </p>

<div class="page-subtitle">2. Surge of LRA attacks near MONUSCO bases in Haut Uele</div>
<p>LRA attacks in Congo were also concentrated in areas close to military forces, particulary near the towns of Niangara and Bangadi where Congolese soldiers and UN peacekeeping (MONUSCO) troops are deployed. In February and March alone, the LRA committed XX attacks near Niangara and Bangadi, abducting XX people and looting XX others. </p>

<div class="page-subtitle">3. Long-term LRA members continue to defect in CAR</div>
<p>17 long-term members of the LRA defected in Q1 2014, including four Ugandan male combatants and 13 women and children. All but one of these defectors escaped in eastern CAR, indicating military operations and Come Home messaging are influencing LRA groups concentrated in that area.</p>

<div class="page-subtitle">4. Large-scale LRA looting raids near Kony’s reported location</div>
<p>Several LRA members who defected reported that Joseph Kony continues to operate in CAR and the neighboring Kafia Kingi enclave, which is controlled by Sudanese troops. LRA forces committed several attacks on Central African towns near Kafia Kingi in Q1 2014 in which they abducted large numbers of people to porter looted goods. As similar patterns in the past suggest, such attacks could be used to resupply Kony and other senior LRA officers.</p>


<h3 class="page-title">I. Obo-Mboki attacks</h3>

<p>This quarter presented the most attacks for Haut-Mbomou in any quarter since mid-2010, with 76% [23 incidents, of which 13 were attacks] of LRA activity in this area taking place around Obo, Mboki or the Obo-Mboki road, in southeastern CAR. This quarter has also revealed a heightened level of boldness from LRA forces, with an increase in attacks targeting vehicles and communities with military personnel present. 71% [30 out of 42] of LRA incidents recorded for CAR took place in Haut-Mbomou, where the majority of counter-LRA and local security forces are located. The general increase in LRA activity in the region combined with this renewed resolve against security forces could suggest a certain level of desperation from LRA members, who are experiencing a severe lack of resources as a result of the dry season and increased pressure of counter-LRA forces, which are keeping them on the move.</p>

</p>This quarter also had the most abductions in Haut-Mbomou for any quarter since late 2011, with reports of 35 civilians abducted. Of these abductions 25 were reportedly short-term (i.e. 3 days or less) and 22 were reportedly used as porters in the aftermath of lootings, before being released shortly after. Furthermore, in at least 4 of these recorded abduction incidents, LRA forces asked detailed questions about the location of security forces and of nearby communities, as well as questions on the movement of civilians along roads. This trend in LRA attacks seems to suggest that LRA forces in Haut-Mbomou are re-supplying themselves during the dry season through highly targeted lootings, heavily informed by details provided during the interrogation of short-term abductees. Overall, this pattern of LRA activity sustains the idea that the LRA forces’ main goal remains survival.</p> 

Already close attacks for all 2013, surpassed abductions
Mention that UPDF apparently withdrew some troops

Analysis - why are they predominantly defecting in Mbomou and HB? (bc this is where most groups are? bc of defection messaging?)
