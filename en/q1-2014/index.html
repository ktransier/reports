<h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary</h3>
LRA targets communities in close proximity to security forces in both CAR and DRC. However, defections are encouraging. 

<div class="page-subtitle">1. LRA targets Central African towns despite Ugandan, US military presence</div>
<p><b><a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/q1-2014/#">1. LRA targets Obo-Mboki axis despite Ugandan, US military presence:</a></b> LRA attacks and abductions surged in CAR’s Haut Mbomou prefecture, despite the presence of Ugandan and US troops that has limited LRA activity there in recent years. The 17 LRA attacks and 35 abductions were the most in a single quarter in Haut Mbomou since late 2011.</p>

<div class="page-subtitle">2. LRA attacks spike near MONUSCO bases in Congo</div>
<p>LRA attacks in Congo were also concentrated in areas close to military forces, particulary near the towns of Niangara and Bangadi where Congolese soldiers and UN peacekeeping (MONUSCO) troops are deployed. In February and March alone, the LRA committed 22 attacks near Niangara and Bangadi, abducting 36 people and looting XX others. </p>

<div class="page-subtitle">3. Long-term LRA members continue to defect in CAR</div>
<p>17 long-term members of the LRA defected in Q1 2014, including four Ugandan male combatants and 13 women and children. All but one of these defectors escaped in eastern CAR.</p>

<div class="page-subtitle">4. Large-scale LRA looting raids near Kony’s reported location</div>
<p>LRA forces committed several large-scale looting raids on Central African towns in Haut Kotto prefecture, which borders the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave. Such attacks could be used to resupply Kony and other senior LRA officers who are reportedly operating there, a pattern consistent with LRA activity in previous years.</p>


<h3 class="page-title">I. LRA targets Central African towns despite Ugandan, US military presence</h3>

<p>The surge in LRA activity in CAR's Haut Mbomou prefecture is unprecedented in recent years, with attack and abduction totals in Q1 2014 nearing or surpassing yearly totals in both 2012 and 2013. The attacks were also unusually bold, with many targeting vehicles and communities near Ugandan and US military bases. Nearly two-thirds of the people abducted in these attacks were forced to porter looted goods into the bush before being released by their captors. During at least four such attacks, LRA forces asked abductees detailed questions about the location of military forces and nearby communities, as well as questions on the movement of civilians along roads.</p> 

<p>Recent attack patterns in Haut Mbomou suggest LRA forces are taking advantage of the dry season to store up food and other supplies, but it remains unclear why they chose to target Haut Mbomou, where the presence of Ugandan and US troops has minimized LRA activity in recent years. Congolese civilians reported several LRA attacks and the presence of an LRA camp just across the border from Haut Mbomou, suggesting LRA groups may be based in Congo but committing attacks in Haut Mbomou to mask the location of their camps. Regardless, Uganda's redeployment of some troops from counter-LRA operations to the civil conflict in South Sudan may be hampering their ability to respond to LRA attacks in Haut Mbomou.</p> 

<h3 class="page-title">II. Congo attack cluster</h3>
<p>LRA violence in Congo's Haut Uele district has reduced dramatically in recent years, and the LRA committed just two attacks there in January, traditionally a period of intense LRA activity. However, LRA attacks surged to their highest monthly total since May 2012 in February, a startling trend given reports that most LRA fighters have moved north into CAR and only 10% of group’s members remain in Congo.</p>

<p>LRA attacks in Haut Uele were concentrated near the communities of Niangara and Bangadi and occurred in three distinct waves. From February 2&ndash;17, LRA forces committed 10 attacks north of Niangara, near the village of Nambia, abducting 12 people and looting at least seven others of property. Civilians also encountered suspected LRA forces in the area three times, including two hunters who saw a large LRA camp near a stream 20km north of Nambia. Then, from February 22&ndash;25, LRA forces committed five attacks near Bangadi, 35km north of Nambia, abducting 22 people and looting 13 others. Finally, LRA forces returned to commit eight additional attacks on communities between Niangara and Bangadi from March 11&ndash;27.  

<p></p>All 22 attacks occurred within 40km of the suspected LRA camp spotted north of Nambia, indicating they may have been committed by the same LRA group. The purpose of these attacks appears primarily to attain food and non-food items, such as corn, palm oil, tools, machetes, boots, clothes, utensils, hunting rifles, and ammunition. As in CAR, LRA forces interrogated abductd about the location of military deployments and patterns in local population movements.</p>

<p>Congolese troops and MONUSCO peacekeepers are deployed in both Bangadi and Niangara, within 30km of all 22 LRA attacks. MONUSCO troops also temporarily deployed to Nambia for several days beginning on February 15, after the LRA group had already committed nine attacks in the area and was beginning to shift north towards Bangadi. As military forces reacted slowly, some civilians reportedly temporarily left Nambia to seek greater security in Niangara. It remains unclear what impact, if any, MONUSCO or Congolese troops have deterring LRA activity in the area.</p>

<h3 class="page-title">III. Defections in CAR </h3>
<p>Highlight defection of Ugandan combatants
Analysis - why are they predominantly defecting in Mbomou and HB? (bc this is where most groups are? bc of defection messaging?) , indicating military operations and Come Home messaging are influencing LRA groups concentrated in that area
Mention of “missed” defection opportunities (in both CAR and DRC)
