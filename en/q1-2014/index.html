<h3 class="page-title">Executive Summary</h3>
LRA targets communities in close proximity to security forces in both CAR and DRC. However, defections are encouraging. 

<div class="page-subtitle">1. LRA targets Central African towns despite Ugandan, US military presence</div>
<p><b><a href="http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/q1-2014/#">1. LRA targets Obo-Mboki axis despite Ugandan, US military presence:</a></b> LRA attacks and abductions surged in CAR’s Haut Mbomou prefecture, despite the presence of Ugandan and US troops that has limited LRA activity there in recent years. The 17 LRA attacks and 35 abductions were the most in a single quarter in Haut Mbomou since late 2011.</p>

<div class="page-subtitle">2. LRA attacks spike near MONUSCO bases in Congo</div>
<p>LRA attacks in Congo were also concentrated in areas close to military forces, particulary near the towns of Niangara and Bangadi where Congolese soldiers and UN peacekeeping (MONUSCO) troops are deployed. In February and March alone, the LRA committed XX attacks near Niangara and Bangadi, abducting XX people and looting XX others. </p>

<div class="page-subtitle">3. Long-term LRA members continue to defect in CAR</div>
<p>17 long-term members of the LRA defected in Q1 2014, including four Ugandan male combatants and 13 women and children. All but one of these defectors escaped in eastern CAR.</p>

<div class="page-subtitle">4. Large-scale LRA looting raids near Kony’s reported location</div>
<p>LRA forces committed several large-scale looting raids on Central African towns in Haut Kotto prefecture, which borders the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave. Such attacks could be used to resupply Kony and other senior LRA officers who are reportedly operating there, a pattern consistent with LRA activity in previous years.</p>


<h3 class="page-title">I. LRA targets Central African towns despite Ugandan, US military presence</h3>

<p>The surge in LRA activity in CAR's Haut Mbomou prefecture is unprecedented in recent years, with attack and abduction totals in Q1 2014 nearing or surpassing yearly totals in both 2012 and 2013. The attacks were also unusually bold, with many targeting vehicles and communities near Ugandan and US military bases. Nearly two-thirds of the people abducted in these attacks were forced to porter looted goods into the bush before being released by their captors. During at least 4 attacks, LRA forces asked abductees detailed questions about the location of military forces and nearby communities, as well as questions on the movement of civilians along roads.</p> 

</p>The general increase in LRA activity in the region combined with this renewed resolve against security forces could suggest a certain level of desperation from LRA members, who are experiencing a severe lack of resources as a result of the dry season and increased pressure of counter-LRA forces, which are keeping them on the move. This trend in LRA attacks seems to suggest that LRA forces in Haut-Mbomou are re-supplying themselves during the dry season through highly targeted lootings. Overall, this pattern of LRA activity sustains the idea that the LRA forces’ main goal remains survival.</p> 

Mention that UPDF apparently withdrew some troops

<h3 class="page-title">III. Defections in CAR </h3>
<p>Highlight defection of Ugandan combatants
Analysis - why are they predominantly defecting in Mbomou and HB? (bc this is where most groups are? bc of defection messaging?) , indicating military operations and Come Home messaging are influencing LRA groups concentrated in that area
Mention of “missed” defection opportunities (in both CAR and DRC)
