<h3 class="page-title-top" id="executive_summary_title" >Executive Summary: Four notable trends in LRA activity, Quarter 1 2014</h3>
<p>The LRA abducted 133 civilians in 63 attacks in the first quarter of 2014 between January and March (Q1 2014). Most notably, LRA forces targeted communities in close proximity to military forces tasked with protecting civilians. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo), LRA forces <a href="#"><strong>committed 25 attacks near the towns of Niangara and Bangadi</strong></a> where Congolese soldiers and UN peacekeeping (MONUSCO) troops are deployed.</p> 

<p>In the Central African Republic (CAR), LRA forces <a href="#obo_mboki"><strong>targeted communities unusually close to Ugandan and US military bases</strong></a>, while also committing several large-scale raids further north where <a href="#"><strong>LRA leader Joseph Kony is reportedly operating</strong></a>. 18 long-term LRA members, including five Ugandan fighters, <a href="#"><strong>defected from the LRA in Q1 2014</strong></a>, all but one in eastern CAR.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="obo_mboki_title">I. LRA targets Central African towns despite Ugandan, US military presence</h3>

<p>The surge in LRA activity in CAR's Haut Mbomou prefecture is unprecedented in recent years, with attack and abduction totals in Q1 2014 nearing or surpassing yearly totals in both 2012 and 2013. The attacks were also unusually bold, with many targeting vehicles and communities near Ugandan and US military bases. Nearly two-thirds of the people abducted in these attacks were forced to porter looted goods into the bush before being released by their captors. During at least four such attacks, LRA forces asked abductees detailed questions about the location of military forces and nearby communities, as well as questions on the movement of civilians along roads.</p>

<p>Recent attack patterns in Haut Mbomou suggest LRA forces are taking advantage of the dry season to store up food and other supplies, but it remains unclear why they chose to target Haut Mbomou, where the presence of Ugandan and US troops has minimized LRA activity in recent years. Congolese civilians reported several LRA attacks and the presence of an LRA camp just across the border from Haut Mbomou, suggesting LRA groups may be based in Congo but committing attacks in Haut Mbomou to mask the location of their camps. Regardless, Uganda's redeployment of some troops from counter-LRA operations to the civil conflict in South Sudan may be hampering their ability to respond to LRA attacks in Haut Mbomou.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="congo_title" >II. Congo attack cluster</h3>

<p>LRA violence in Congo's Haut Uele district has reduced dramatically in recent years, and the LRA committed just two attacks there in January, traditionally a period of intense LRA activity. However, LRA attacks surged to their highest monthly total since May 2012 in February, a startling trend given reports that most LRA fighters have moved north into CAR and only 10% of group’s members remain in Congo.</p>

<p>LRA attacks in Haut Uele were concentrated near the communities of Niangara and Bangadi and occurred in three distinct waves. From February 2&ndash;17, LRA forces committed 11 attacks north of Niangara, near the village of Nambia, abducting 12 people and looting at least seven others of property. Civilians also encountered suspected LRA forces in the area three times, including two hunters who saw a large LRA camp near a stream 20km north of Nambia. Then, from February 22&ndash;25, LRA forces committed five attacks near Bangadi, 35km north of Nambia, abducting 22 people and looting 13 others. Finally, LRA forces returned to commit eight additional attacks on communities between Niangara and Bangadi from March 11&ndash;27.</p>

<div class="map" id="nambia-map"></div>

<p></p>The close proximity of all 24 attacks suggests they were committed by a single LRA group, likely the one camped by the stream north of Nambia. The attacks were aimed primarily at attaining food and non-food items, such as corn, palm oil, machetes, boots, clothes, utensils, hunting rifles, and ammunition. As in CAR, LRA forces interrogated abductd people about the location of military deployments and patterns in local population movements.</p>

<div id="Q12014_HU" class="visual" style="height: 350px; margin-top: 0px;"></div> 

<p>Congolese troops and MONUSCO peacekeepers are deployed in both Bangadi and Niangara, within 30km of all 24 LRA attacks. MONUSCO troops also temporarily deployed to Nambia for several days beginning on February 15, after the LRA group had already committed nine attacks in the area and was beginning to shift north towards Bangadi. As military forces reacted slowly, some civilians reportedly temporarily left Nambia to seek greater security in Niangara. It remains unclear what impact, if any, MONUSCO or Congolese troops have deterring LRA activity in the area.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="resupplying_kony_title" name="resupplying_kony">IV. Exploiting CAR from Sudan?</h3>
<p>LRA leader Joseph Kony has operated periodically in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave, which borders CAR's Haut Kotto and Vakaga prefectures, since XX. Kony has utiziled Kafia Kingi in multiple ways: as a safe haven from pursuing Ugandan troops, as a marketplace to barter ivory poached in Congo, and as an outpost to rekindle the LRA's historic relationship with the Sudanese military. Not wanting to alienate the Sudanese military, LRA forces have rarely if ever attacked civilians in the enclave. Instead, they have periodically sent raiding parties into CAR to loot civilians there, beginning with a series of XX attacks in XX 2010.</p>

<div class="map-title">LRA camp location in Kafia Kingi and attacks in eastern Haut Kotto and Vakaga  | 2012-2014</div>
<div class="map" id="northern-attacks-map"></div>

<p>Kony was last confirmed to be in Kafia Kingi in March 2013, when he fled to CAR just before Ugandan troops launched an attack on his camps there. After a series of large-scale raids on Central African towns in the aftermathof the Ugandan operations, LRA forces went relatively silent.</p>

<p>In December 2013, LRA activity in Haut Kotto began to increase. Since then, the LRA has committed nine attacks in the vicinity of Sam Ouandja, a diamond mining town just XX km from the border with Kafia Kingi. These attacks have been unusually violent, with many involving the abduction of large groups of people who are forces to porter looted supplies into the bush before being released. These attack patterns are very similar to those in 2010, and could indicate senior LRA officers such as Kony have returned to Kafia Kingi. Reports from several LRA fighters who defected in early 2014 also indicated Kony had returned Kafia Kingi by late 2013.</p>
