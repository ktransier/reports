<h3 class="page-title-top edge-top" id="executive_summary_title" >Executive Summary: Seasonal spike in LRA attacks, more defections in CAR</h3>
<p>The LRA abducted 133 civilians in 63 attacks between January and March 2014 (Quarter 1 2014), continuing a historical pattern in which the group increases attacks during the early year dry season. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo), LRA forces <a href="#section_2"><strong>targeted civilians near the towns of Niangara and Bangadi</strong></a>, undeterred by the presence of Congolese soldiers and UN peacekeeping (MONUSCO) bases there. However, LRA forces <a href="#section_1"><strong>committed only two attacks near Garamba National Park</strong></a>, a level of security not seen there since mid-2008.</p> 

<p>In the Central African Republic (CAR), LRA forces <a href="#section_3"><strong>targeted civilians near Ugandan and US military bases</strong></a> in Haut Mbomou prefecture. Further north, in the CAR's Haut Kotto prefecture, LRA forces also <a href="#section_4"><strong>committed several large-scale raids</strong></a> in an area where LRA leader Joseph Kony frequently operates. Long-term LRA members continued to defect in eastern CAR, with <a href="#section_5"><strong>five Ugandan fighters and 13 women and children defecting there</strong></a> in Quarter 1 2014.

<h3 class="page-title" id="section_1_title" >I. Dramatic drop in LRA activity near Garamba National Park</h3>
<p>The LRA first entered Congo's Garamba National Park in 2005, and nearly the entire LRA force lived there in established camps during the 2006&ndash;2008 Juba peace talks. Most LRA groups left the park following the collapse of the peace talks in December 2008, but Kony has entrusted a series of commanders with maintaining LRA bases there, from which they have poached elephants and launched raids on civilians. Between January 2012 and September 2013 alone, LRA forces abducted 158 people in 143 attacks on communities surrounding the park.</p>

<p>In mid-September 2013, South Sudanese troops with the African Union's counter-LRA force, utilizing US military intelligence and accompanied by US Special Operations Forces, destroyed several suspected LRA bases in Garamba National Park. Over the next six months (October 2013&ndash;March 2014), LRA forces committed 11 attacks on communities west of the park, but none south or east of the park.</p>

<div id="Q12014_F" class="visual" style="height: 300px; margin-top: 0px;"></div> 

<p>It is difficult to determine whether all LRA groups have left Garamba National Park, or, if so, whether the operations were the most important factor in their exodus. However, the map below, which compares LRA attacks on communities surrounding the park in the six months preceding the AU operations and in the six months following the operations, clearly demonstrates that these communities have enjoyed a level of security unprecedented since 2008.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="section_2_title" >II. LRA raids Niangara&ndash;Bangadi area with impunity</h3>

<p>While LRA attacks have reduced dramatically near Garamba National Park, they have increased further west in Haut Uele district, indicating LRA groups formerly based in the park may have moved there. In February and March 2014, LRA groups particularly targeted communities near the towns of Niangara and Bangadi, abducting 34 people and looting 39 others in 24 attacks&ndash;exceeding the totals for that area for the previous 12 months combined.

<p>The LRA attacks near Niangara and Bangadi occurred in three distinct waves. From February 2&ndash;17, LRA forces committed 11 attacks north of Niangara, near the village of Nambia, abducting 12 people and looting at least seven others. Then, from February 22&ndash;25, LRA forces committed five attacks near Bangadi, 35km north of Nambia, abducting 22 people and looting 13 others. Finally, LRA forces committed eight additional attacks in the area between from March 11&ndash;27. Most of the attacks were aimed obtaining food and items such as machetes, boots, clothing, and ammunition.</p>

<p>Other armed groups were also active in Haut Uele in Quarter 1 2014. In particular, tensions between Mbororo cattle herders and primarily Zande agricultural communities continued to simmer, resulting in 12 incidents involving conflict, including seven in the vicinity of Niangara and Bangadi. In addition, there were 19 attacks in which the armed perpetrator was unidentified. Such attacks may have been perpetrated by bandits, the LRA, Mbororo, rogue Congolese soldiers, or poachers.</p>

<p>Despite the presence of other armed groups in Haut Uele, there is significant evidence the LRA committed many of the attacks reported there in Quarter 1 2014, particularly those near Niangara and Bangadi. The perpetrators of the reported LRA attacks exhibited several classic LRA indicators usually distinct from other armed groups, such as communicating in Acholi or an "unknown" language, attacking in groups composed of women and children in addition to men, and abducting civilians. In several attacks, LRA forces interrogated abductees about military deployments and civilian travel patterns, a frequent LRA practice. In addition, two Congolese hunters reported seeing a large LRA camp near a stream 35km north of Niangara on February 22.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>Congolese troops and MONUSCO peacekeepers are deployed in both Bangadi and Niangara, within 30km of all 24 LRA attacks reported in the area. MONUSCO troops also temporarily deployed to Nambia for several days beginning on February 15, after the LRA group had already committed nine attacks in the area and was beginning to shift north towards Bangadi.</p> 
    
    <p>As military forces reacted slowly, some civilians reportedly temporarily left Nambia to seek greater security in Niangara. It remains unclear what impact, if any, MONUSCO or Congolese troops have had in deterring LRA activity in the area.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="section_3_title">III. LRA targets Central African towns despite Ugandan, US military presence</h3>

<p>LRA forces abducted 35 people in 17 attacks in the CAR's Haut Mbomou prefecture in the first three months of 2014. The attacks were also unusually bold, with 11 of the 17 attacks occurring within 15km of US and Ugandan bases in the towns of Obo and Mboki. Nearly two-thirds of the people abducted in the LRA's attacks in Haut Mbomou were forced to porter looted goods into the bush before being released by their captors. During at least four such attacks, LRA forces asked abductees detailed questions about the location of military forces and nearby communities, as well as the movement of civilians along nearby roads.</p> 

<p>Recent attack patterns in Haut Mbomou suggest LRA forces are taking advantage of the dry season to store up food and other supplies, but it remains unclear why they chose to target Haut Mbomou, where the presence of Ugandan and US troops has minimized LRA activity in recent years. The 17 attacks and 35 abductions in Haut Mbomou in Quarter 1 2014 approach or surpass yearly attack and abduction totals there in both 2012 and 2013.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>Congolese civilians reported several LRA attacks and the presence of an LRA camp just across the border from Haut Mbomou, suggesting LRA groups may be based in Congo but committing attacks in Haut Mbomou to mask the location of their camps. Regardless, Uganda's redeployment of some troops from counter-LRA operations to the civil conflict in South Sudan may be hampering their ability to respond to LRA attacks in Haut Mbomou.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="section_4_title" name="resupplying_kony">IV. Exploiting the CAR from Sudan?</h3>
<p>LRA leader Joseph Kony has operated periodically in the Sudanese-controlled Kafia Kingi enclave, which borders CAR's Haut Kotto and Vakaga prefectures, since 2010. Kony has utiziled Kafia Kingi in multiple ways: as a safe haven from pursuing Ugandan troops, as a marketplace to barter ivory poached in Congo, and as an outpost to rekindle the LRA's historic relationship with the Sudanese military. Not wanting to alienate the Sudanese military, LRA forces have rarely if ever attacked civilians in the enclave. Instead, they have periodically sent raiding parties into CAR to loot civilians there, beginning with a series of eight attacks in Haut Kotto and Vakaga prefectures in late 2010.</p>

<p>Kony was last confirmed to be in Kafia Kingi in March 2013, just before he fled to the CAR in advance of an Uganda military attack on his camps in the enclave. After a series of large-scale raids on Central African towns in the aftermath of the Ugandan operations, LRA forces went relatively silent.</p>

<p>In December 2013, LRA activity in Haut Kotto began to increase. Since then, the LRA has committed nine attacks in the vicinity of Sam Ouandja, a diamond mining town less than 50km from the Kafia Kingi border. These attacks have been unusually violent, with many involving the abduction of large groups of people who are forced to porter looted supplies into the bush before being released. These attack patterns are very similar to those in 2010, and could indirectly corroborate reports from several LRA fighters who defected in early 2014 that Kony had returned to Kafia Kingi by late 2013.</p>

<h3 class="page-title" id="section_5_title">V. Ugandan LRA combatants, women, children defect in the CAR </h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
<p>18 LRA members who had been with the group for at least six months defected in Quarter 1 2014, including five Ugandan male combatants and 13 women and children.

<p>All five Ugandan male combatants who escaped the LRA defected in eastern CAR. Since 2012, XX% of all Ugandan combatant defectors have escaped in eastern CAR, most commonly in the Vovodo-Chinko river basin and near towns with Ugandan military bases such as Mboki, Djemah, and Obo. The concentration of LRA combatant defections in this area is likely due to a number of factors, including the presence of Ugandan military bases, the concentration of LRA groups in the CAR, and the relative saturation of "Come Home" defection messaging there.</p>
