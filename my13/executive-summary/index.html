  <h3 class="section-title"> Executive Summary </h3>

  <h5>Seleka rebels overthrow CAR government</h5>
  <p>In January 2013 President Francois Bozize signed agreements with Seleka rebels in Libreville,
  Gabon aimed at halting the advance of the rebel movement in CAR. However, in
  March Seleka rebels resumed hostilities and captured Bangui, forcing Bozize to flee the
  country. The new government, led by Michael Djotodia, has since struggled to control
  looting and human rights abuses by Seleka troops. Neither the African Union (AU) nor
  the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) initially recognized Djotodia's
  legitimacy, and ECCAS led efforts to secure the new governments agreement to
  an 18-month transitional process that will culminate in drafting a new constitution and
  national elections.</p>
  <h5>Ugandan and US troops suspend operations in CAR</h5>
  <p>Following Seleka's takeover of Bangui in March, Ugandan and US troops officially suspended
  counter-LRA operations in CAR. Ugandan troops, in CAR as part of the AU
  Regional Task Force (RTF), have withdrawn to bases in Obo, Djemah, and Dembia in
  CAR, while US troops have consolidated in their Obo base. Both the AU Peace and
  Security Council and United Nations (UN) Security Council have expressed support
  for continued counter-LRA operations by Ugandan troops, and Seleka representatives
  have indicated that the Ugandan military can resume counter-LRA operations in Haut
  Mbomou prefecture. Ugandan officials, citing security concerns, have not indicated when
  the Ugandan military will resume deployments of tracking teams and other patrols.</p>
  <h5>Congo military dedicates troops to AU RTF</h5>
  <p>In February 2013, the Congolese military officially handed over 500 troops to the AU
  RTF in a ceremony in Dungu, Congo. Though hailed by the international community as
  a hopeful sign that Kinshasa will improve cooperation with regional counter-LRA efforts,
  Congolese civil society leaders expressed concern that the move will exacerbate civilian
  protection concerns in the short term. The Congolese military reportedly redeployed
  some troops from outlying towns at higher risk of LRA attack to the AU RTF sector
  headquarters in Dungu, leaving civilians in remote areas more vulnerable to LRA attacks.</p>
  <h5>US announces $5 million award for indicted LRA leaders</h5>
  <p>In April 2013, the US State Department announced a $5 million award for information
  leading to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of LRA leaders indicted by the International
  Criminal Court (ICC). Of the five LRA commanders indicted by the LRA in 2005, Joseph
  Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen remain at large with the rebel group.</p>
