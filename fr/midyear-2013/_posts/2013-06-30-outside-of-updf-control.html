  <p>The insecurity caused by the proliferation of armed groups in eastern CAR has allowed LRA groups to exploit vast stretches of ungoverned territory. The LRA committed 25 attacks in CAR in the first six months of 2013, killing 35 people and abducting 112 others, though attack patterns varied significantly in different prefectures. In Haut Mbomou prefecture and the eastern edge of Mbomou prefecture, where Ugandan troops are deployed in several locations and have prevented the advance of Seleka factions, the LRA committed 11 attacks, killing XX people and abducting XX others. Aside from one attack in which LRA forces abducted 13 hunters, these attacks were primarily small scale looting raids on isolated farmers or travelers, a trend largely consistent with LRA attacks in areas of CAR under more direct UPDF influence in 2012. Overall, the LRA committed XX attacks in areas of CAR under UPDF influence between January 2012 and June 2013.</p>

  <p>In Haut Kotto prefecture and western Mbomou prefecture, where US and Ugandan troops have far more limited access, Seleka factions are deployed in several towns but provide little security to the civilian population. In Haut Kotto, the LRA committed several highly violent attacks in the first half of 2013 in which they killed 26 people and abducuted 83 others. LRA activity followed a similar pattern in 2012, during which they committed several brazen attacks on large villages in Haut Kotto and western Mbomou outside of Ugandan military influence, abducting over XX people and looting large amounts of food and supplies. Overall, XX% of mass LRA attacks in CAR between January 2012 and June 2013 occurred in areas not under UPDF influence, and the LRA abducted nearly double(?) the amount of people per attack in areas outside of UPDF influence (X.X) as they did in areas under UPDF influence (X.X).</p>
