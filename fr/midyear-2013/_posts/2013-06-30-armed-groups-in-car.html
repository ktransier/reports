  <div class="caption">LRA Area of Operation vs. Armed Groups Operating in Eastern CAR  </div>

  <p>A patchwork of armed groups currently operate in LRA-affected areas of eastern CAR. In Haut Mbomou prefecture, Ugandan military forces remain in control of major towns, though they faced a temporary threat from an overmatched armed group that approached the town of Obo in April 2013. The group reportedly consisted primarily of farmers from neighboring South Sudan misled into thinking they would be attacking the LRA.</p>

  <p>In Mbomou prefecture, Seleka rebels occupied and looted communities in LRA-affected areas following the March coup, displacing hundreds of people along the Bangassou-Rafai and Bangassou-Bakouma roads. In mid-July, a UFDR faction of Seleka attempted to wrest control of Bangassou from the CPSK faction, leading to clashes that left several dead. Seleka also remains in control of Haut Kotto, with troops deployed in towns such as Bria and Sam Ouandja. In Vakaga, the Tripartite Force â€“ which bring together troops from Chad, CAR, and Sudan  remains deployed in the regional capital of Birao.</p>
