  <p>LRA attack patterns in Congo differ significantly from those CAR, with LRA raids in Congo consisting primarily of small-scale looting raids in which few people are abducted or killed. From January 2012 - June 2013, LRA groups committed XX% of all attacks in Congo, but only XX% all killings and XX% of all abductions. In the first half of 2013, the LRA abducted more than 5 people in only one of its 65 attacks in Congo.></p>
