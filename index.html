<h2> Executive Summary </h2>

<h5>Seleka rebels overthrow CAR government</h5>
<p>In January 2013 President Francois Bozize signed agreements with Seleka rebels in Libreville,
Gabon aimed at halting the advance of the rebel movement in CAR. However, in
March Seleka rebels resumed hostilities and captured Bangui, forcing Bozize to flee the
country. The new government, led by Michael Djotodia, has since struggled to control
looting and human rights abuses by Seleka troops. Neither the African Union (AU) nor
the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) initially recognized Djotodia's
legitimacy, and ECCAS led efforts to secure the new governments agreement to
an 18-month transitional process that will culminate in drafting a new constitution and
national elections.</p>
<h5>Ugandan and US troops suspend operations in CAR</h5>
<p>Following Seleka's takeover of Bangui in March, Ugandan and US troops officially suspended
counter-LRA operations in CAR. Ugandan troops, in CAR as part of the AU
Regional Task Force (RTF), have withdrawn to bases in Obo, Djemah, and Dembia in
CAR, while US troops have consolidated in their Obo base. Both the AU Peace and
Security Council and United Nations (UN) Security Council have expressed support
for continued counter-LRA operations by Ugandan troops, and Seleka representatives
have indicated that the Ugandan military can resume counter-LRA operations in Haut
Mbomou prefecture. Ugandan officials, citing security concerns, have not indicated when
the Ugandan military will resume deployments of tracking teams and other patrols.</p>
<h5>Congo military dedicates troops to AU RTF</h5>
<p>In February 2013, the Congolese military officially handed over 500 troops to the AU
RTF in a ceremony in Dungu, Congo. Though hailed by the international community as
a hopeful sign that Kinshasa will improve cooperation with regional counter-LRA efforts,
Congolese civil society leaders expressed concern that the move will exacerbate civilian
protection concerns in the short term. The Congolese military reportedly redeployed
some troops from outlying towns at higher risk of LRA attack to the AU RTF sector
headquarters in Dungu, leaving civilians in remote areas more vulnerable to LRA attacks.</p>
<h5>US announces $5 million award for indicted LRA leaders</h5>
<p>In April 2013, the US State Department announced a $5 million award for information
leading to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of LRA leaders indicted by the International
Criminal Court (ICC). Of the five LRA commanders indicted by the LRA in 2005, Joseph
Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen remain at large with the rebel group.</p>
